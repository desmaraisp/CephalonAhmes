														<strong>ANGELS OF THE ZARIMAN QUEST </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The Zariman Ten Zero cries out into the endless darkness that
														surrounds it. In a post-New War world, something lingers in the
														Void-ridden ship once inhabited by the Tenno. Its wailing can be
														heard from afar. Return to it, find the source of its song, and
														unearth the memories echoing throughout the vacant corridors. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Quest Prerequisite:</strong> You must have The New War
														quest completed in order to unlock the Angels of the Zariman
														quest in your Codex. <br>
														If you have not completed The New War, check out our helpful
														guide: <a

														<strong>Similar to the Saya’s Vigil, Vox Solaris, and Heart of
															Deimos quests, this is a solo gameplay-focused experience
															that will introduce you to key characters and Zariman
															related content. </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Completing the quest will reward you with gifts from the Void in
														your Inbox! <br><br>
														Once you have completed the Angels of the Zariman quest, the
														following gameplay options will become available for you to
														start venturing deeper into the ship: 
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Zariman Bounties 
														</li>
														<li>
															3x New Missions Types 
														</li>
													</ul>

														<strong>NEW TILESET: ZARIMAN </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Go back to where it all began, Tenno. The horrors of the past
														that took place on the Zariman Ten Zero may be overshadowed by
														the phantasmic energies that now reside there. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Characterized by its overgrown state and constant flow of Void
														energy, it has taken a new form. Between the golden figures and
														trinkets littered around from before the Void-Jump accident, the
														Void pulses through its veins, twisting and bending the Zariman
														to its will. The accident left the ship in disarray, with many
														nooks and crannies that can be discovered and explored. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Explore with caution, Tenno -- even though you may recognize
														areas from your past, everything is not what it seems. 
													</p>

													<p>
														The Zariman appears in the Star Chart after completing The New
														War quest, but is only accessible after completing the Angels of
														the Zariman quest. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Optimization Tip for PC Players:</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Be advised that the Zariman tileset is optimized for and looks
														best with the ‘Enhanced’ Graphics Engine option enabled. We
														recommend you switch to this under the ‘Video’ tab in Options if
														your system can handle it to enjoy the finer details of this
														lush new map! <br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Zariman Tileset Resources:</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Ferrite, Alloy Plate, Voidgel Orb (NEW), Entrati Lanthorns
														(NEW), and Thrax Plasm are dropped from enemies and can be found
														in Resource Deposits around the Zariman tileset.  
													</p>

													<p>
														These new resources can also be fed to Helminth. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Voidplumes:</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Voidplumes are tokens shed from Void Manifestations which can be
														used for many things, including:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Turned in for Standing in the Chrysalith for a new
															Syndicate.
														</li>
														<li>
															Used in certain crafting recipes. 
														</li>
														<li>
															Used to purchase Voidplume decorations and Kuva from a new
															vendor’s supplies in the Chrysalith. 
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														Voidplumes can be earned as Bounty rewards. They can also be
														found scattered around the Zariman tileset in a similar fashion
														to Syndicate Medallions. Each mission spawns 8 Voidplumes for
														keen-eyed Tenno to find! A prompt will appear letting you know
														how many more Plumes can be found in-mission after picking one
														up. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Similar to Medallions, there are various tiers with different
														Standing values: higher tiers of Voidplumes can be earned by
														killing special Void manifestation enemies or from
														<strong>Melica Caches</strong>, while lower tiers can be found
														in-mission and from Bounty drop tables. Listed below are the
														tiers from lowest to highest: 
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Voidplume Down
														</li>
														<li>
															Voidplume Vane
														</li>
														<li>
															Voidplume Quill
														</li>
														<li>
															Voidplume Crest
														</li>
														<li>
															Voidplume Pinion
														</li>
													</ul>

													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Melica Caches &amp; Zarium Accolades: </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Zarium Accolades</strong> are required to open new
														caches locked by Cephalon Melica - whom you may remember from
														your time in the classroom. Melica Caches are marked for your
														convenience when you’re nearby. To unlock the <strong>Melica
															Cache</strong>, you will need to locate a Zarium Accolade  -
														keep an ear out for their distinct sound, or use Loot Radar!
														Once you find a Zarium Accolade, you can pick them up and bring
														them to the Melica Console to unlock a Voidplume Quill within.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em>Melica Caches appear only once the Angels of the Zariman
															quest is complete, they cannot be found during the
															quest. </em>
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>New Somachord Fragments: </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Hunt down and scan Somachord Tones throughout the Zariman
														tileset to unlock 3 new tracks:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															On Corroded Wings
														</li>
														<li>
															The Offering
														</li>
														<li>
															Canticle
														</li>
													</ul>

													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>NEW ENEMIES </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The Zariman brings with it new threats. Aboard the ship you will
														go toe to toe with the following fresh-faced foes: 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Kuva Trokarian</strong><br>
														The Worm Queen has bestowed these troopers with a miniature Kuva
														Trokar to disrupt transference. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Derivator Crewman</strong><br>
														Using the latest in Corpus weapons technology, this Crewman
														absorbs damage, until it unleashes it all in a powerful
														shockwave. The Derivator unit is mounted on the back.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Thrax Centurion </strong><br>
														Equipped with a deadly Scythe, they emanate an energy unknown to
														us. These mysterious creatures can be found in Zariman
														missions. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Thrax Legatus</strong><br>
														Armed and ready with a Rifle, they emanate an energy unknown to
														us. These mysterious creatures can be found in Zariman
														missions. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Codename: Void Manifestations </strong><br>
														Its true name and nature shall be revealed to you soon,
														Tenno…<br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>

													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>NEW HUB: CHRYSALITH </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														A familiar location that was first ventured during The New War,
														the <strong>Chrysalith</strong> is at the heart of the Zariman.
														A sanctuary whose bridged walk paths and vistas were once
														enjoyed by its original passengers is now repurposed as a hub
														for returning visitors and warriors fending off against the
														Grineer, Corpus, and others that lay waiting in the halls of the
														Zariman. 
													</p>

													<p>
														During the Angels of the Zariman quest, you will be introduced
														to a band of new characters and a new Syndicate who call the
														Chrysalith home. After you have completed the quest, you will be
														able to visit the Chrysalith with other Tenno, as you would
														Fortuna or Cetus. 
													</p>

													<p>
														The Chrysalith is also the first social hub of its kind that
														allows you to seamlessly access procedural missions without load
														screens. Jump between missions without ever having to return to
														your Orbiter’s Navigation.   
													</p>

													<p>
														While inside the Chrysalith, opening the map will display what
														enemy faction is currently active within the Zariman. Grineer
														and Corpus squads rotate every 2.5 hours.
													</p>

													<p>
														<img alt="9aef3a5d995b1c219ee511d92eafb670.jpg" class="ipsImage"

													</p>

													<p>
														This is also indicated by the faction ships closing the distance
														between themselves and the Zariman in the Star Chart. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>NEW SYNDICATE</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														A new Syndicate is revealed after completing the Angels of the
														Zariman quest. Band together with Syndicate members stationed in
														the Chrysalith and gain access to Bounties, Incarnon Weapons,
														Dormizone &amp; Voidshell goods, and more!  
													</p>

													<p>
														Work your way through the Ranks from Fallen to Angel, and forge
														bonds to uncover more about the present predicament of the
														Zariman. This Syndicate can also be accessed from the Syndicate
														segment in your Orbiter. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>ZARIMAN BOUNTIES</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Once you have completed the Quest, Bounties become available
														from within the Chrysalith! These Bounties offer additional
														challenges for players looking to show their Mastery of the
														mission types on the Zariman - you will need to bring the best
														gear for the job! Players can play through the regular versions
														of these missions from the Star Chart, or opt for the Bounty
														version for different rewards and Syndicate standing. The Bounty
														versions are intended to be much more challenging! 
													</p>

													<p>
														Bounties are structured with a distinct objective that must be
														completed before the player can extract -- or in certain cases
														can cause a mission failure if the player is unsuccessful. Upon
														mission completion, players also earn Voidplumes in addition to
														the Bounty drop table rewards The higher the difficulty, the
														harder the challenge, the more Plumes are given! 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Bounty Rewards: </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The following possible rewards can be earned by playing the
														Bounties:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>

														<strong>NEW MISSIONS TYPES </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The Zariman brings with it three new endless mission types:
														<strong>Void Flood, Void Cascade</strong>, and <strong>Void
															Armageddon</strong>. These missions offer new enemies and
														challenges! Accompanying these are Exterminate and Mobile
														Defense mission nodes set in the new Zariman tileset. After
														completing the Angels of the Zariman Quest, you can start these
														missions from the Star Chart, or by entering the elevator in the
														Chrysalith and interacting with the <strong>Zariman
															Navigation</strong> panel.

													</p>

													<p>
														The enemies you will face aboard the Zariman depends on which
														faction have staked their claim on the ship. Word of the
														time-forgotten riches aboard the Zariman has made its way onto
														both Corpus and Grineer wavelengths. While only one faction will
														be aboard the Zariman at a time, you can expect to see even
														rotations of these factions every 2.5 hours as each one fights
														to claim their time aboard the fabled Zariman.
													</p>

													<p>
														Base Focus Lenses for each Focus School are in Rotation C of the
														drop tables for these new endless missions. We wanted to add a
														new means of earning Lenses in light of all of the Focus
														changes, while also making later stages of the endless missions
														worth your while. 
													</p>

													<p>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>VOID FLOOD (EVERVIEW ARC)</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Forces born of Void and agony are clawing at the Albrecht
														membrane, creating <strong>Ruptures </strong>that saturate areas
														of the Zariman with Void energy. Introducing <strong>Void
															Flood</strong> - a parkour-heavy endless mission focused on
														maintaining the stability of the Zariman’s Automatic Vitoplast
														system.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>How to play:</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The goal is to mend these Ruptures, and in order to do so you
														must collect essential <strong>Vitoplast </strong>on-board the
														Zariman and deliver it to the location of these <strong>Void
															Ruptures</strong>. The amount of Vitoplast you collect is
														indicated by the floating globe accompanying you as you hunt it
														down. The globe fills with Vitoplast as it is collected, and
														drains when you are near a Void Rupture. Void Flood will test
														your refined parkour skills, as the anti-gravity properties of
														Vitoplast have them scattered high and low across the Zariman. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Be warned, failure to close the Ruptures flood the Zariman with
														uncontrollable <strong>Void Contamination </strong>that can
														enhance your enemy and hinder your strength in various different
														ways, or even cause the Vitoplast itself to act erratically. The
														higher levels of Void Contamination present on the Zariman, the
														greater the challenge. Contamination levels are indicated in a
														gauge in the HUD, with three levels of randomized effects that
														will trigger when hit:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															First level = 40% 
														</li>
														<li>
															Second level = 70% 
														</li>
														<li>
															Final level = 100%
															<ul>
																<li>
																	Hitting 100% will start a countdown timer, if the
																	Contamination levels are not lowered by closing
																	Ruptures within that time, players will be forced to
																	extract as the environment has become inhospitable. 
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														Every three Ruptures sealed summons a <strong>Thrax
															Centurion</strong> - a strong foe made of both armor and
														Void energy looking to keep you from sealing up the Ruptures.
														Your synergy between Warframe and Operator will be required to
														take down this quick and relentless enemy. Similar to Eximus
														Units, Thrax Centurions are imbued with Overguard (more on this
														in the Eximus Reborn section below) which fortifies their
														stance. Thrax Centurions also directly reward 2,500 Focus Points
														of the players’ active Focus School for all of those who are
														within Affinity range once defeated. 
													</p>

													<p>
														You will have the choice to extract after sealing
														<strong>three</strong> Ruptures successfully, which also counts
														as one full round in this endless mission. 
													</p>

													<p>
														The success and length of your mission is fully dependent on
														your ability to balance consistent damage with elegant parkour.
														If you can keep up both to the standards of the Zariman Ten
														Zero, you will be nobly rewarded.
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>VOID CASCADE (TUVUL COMMONS)</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Enemies of the Zariman have caused a great imbalance using the
														Void energy perforating its walls and manifesting in truly
														horrifying ways. Introducing <strong>Void Cascade</strong> -  an
														endless mission mode where you are tasked with cleansing
														Void-possessed Exolizers to restore the Zariman’s systems.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>How to play:</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The goal is to combat the Void using devices known as
														<strong>Exolizers.</strong> But even the advanced Zariman tech
														cannot resist the Void forever. It’s up to you to purge them of
														the Void, and fight off a complete and total Cascade. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Exolizers possessed by the Void are protected by it. Your
														Operator is key in cleansing it to allow the Exolizer to begin
														its purging process. Possessed and purged Exolizers are tracked
														in the HUD, alongside the gauge that indicates the level at
														which the ship is reaching a Cascade-level disaster. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Upon cleansing an Exolizer, Tenno must face a <strong>Thrax
															Centurian</strong> which has possessed the machine, but they
														will not give up without a fight. If they are not killed
														quickly, it will feed the Cascade by re-possessing another
														Exolizer and accelerate the chaos. The more you cleanse, the
														more chaotic it can get - it will require great focus and skill
														to maintain the Exolizers the longer you stay. 
													</p>

													<p>
														If you’d rather flee the battle and bank your rewards, it will
														require <strong>four</strong> successful purged Exolizers to
														unlock extraction, which also counts as one full round in this
														endless mission.
													</p>

													<p>
														If players are unable to fend off the Cascade and the gauge
														reaches 100%, extraction will become available. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Restoring the systems of the Zariman won’t be easy, but is
														necessary to reclaim the ship. It will require great strength
														and coordination to quell the Cascade, but those who stay to
														fight will be compensated for their efforts. <br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>VOID ARMAGEDDON (ORO WORKS)</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Grineer and Corpus enemies have boarded the Zariman and are
														targeting its <strong>Reliquary </strong>for destruction.
														Exquisitely twisted creations and their minions seek to do the
														same. <strong>Void Armageddon</strong> tests your ability to
														prioritize targets: defend against enemies while protecting the
														Reliquary aboard the Zariman and the Exodampers that aid you in
														your objective. Assemble your Arsenal wisely, as this mission is
														not for the ill-prepared.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>How to play: </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The goal is to defend the Reliquary from the waves of threats
														that are looking to destroy it. To aid you in your defense
														are<strong> Exodampers</strong>. These towers will weaken your
														enemy while they are active, but if destroyed will strengthen
														them with randomized buffs until the Exodampers respawn. While
														not essential, without your<strong> </strong>Exodampers, your
														enemy can focus fire on the Reliquary. If your enemies succeed
														in destroying it, you will be forced to accept defeat and return
														back to the Chrysalith. As the chaos grows, Void manifestations
														will attempt to drain the Reliquary using Void energy. You can
														track how much of the Reliquary has been drained using the
														percentage icon above it. If the Reliquary is fully drained, you
														will have failed your mission. Destroyed or drained, you must
														fight to prevent the Reliquary from meeting either fates.
													</p>

													<p>
														Void Armageddon consists of <strong>Rounds</strong> and
														<strong>Waves</strong>:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															<strong>Waves: </strong>Enemies will try to destroy
															Exodampers in waves. To complete a wave, you must eliminate
															the squad of enemies sent to the Exodamper.  After each
															wave, your enemies will begin to attack from a different
															angle - follow the instructions on your HUD and move swiftly
															to the next Exodamper to defend. 
														</li>
														<li>
															<strong>Rounds: </strong>A full round consists of
															<strong>three waves.  </strong>
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														If you fail to protect your Exodampers, they will remain
														destroyed until the<strong> next round.</strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															For clarity - if an Exodamper is destroyed in Wave 1 in
															Round 1, it will respawn at the start of Round 2, or the 4th
															Wave in total.
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														Grineer and Corpus will be the least of your worries the longer
														you defend, as Void manifestations appear every three waves and
														will stand in your way between completing rounds. Traditional
														combat will be necessary to make a dent, but your skills as your
														Operator are crucial to defeating this foe. If you succeed in
														this fight, you and your squad (those within Affinity range of
														the enemy when defeated) will be rewarded with Focus Points as
														well as a high-tier Voidplume which must be picked up.
													</p>

													<p>
														Completing one round of Void Armageddon will unlock extraction,
														but enemies will continue to attack until you can fight no
														longer.
													</p>

													<p>
														You aren’t alone in your efforts. By taking advantage of the
														Zariman’s built-in defenses, you can utilize strategically
														placed <strong>Armaments</strong> - specialized turrets. They
														can be used to hold off the onslaught of enemies at all angles,
														but must be constructed first. To build these turrets, locate
														and capture <strong>Argozene Drops</strong>, which will provide
														the <strong>Argozene</strong> to construct them. To unlock a
														Drop, you must stand within the indicated zone around it and
														wait until the box is fully enveloped with energy - at which
														point it will open and shower you with the crafting material.
														Argozene is also dropped from fallen enemies. Collected Argozene
														is shared amongst your squad, so coordinating with them will be
														required to optimize your strategy. 
													</p>

													<p>
														As long as you have the required Argozene, you can choose from a
														variety of Armaments to craft:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															<strong>Mazuka </strong>- Minigun turret that focuses on one
															target at a time. 
														</li>
														<li>
															<strong>Faradon</strong> - Arc lightning turret that can
															strike multiple targets at once. 
														</li>
														<li>
															<strong>Corralizer </strong>- Trap turret that grabs enemies
															and pulls them in. 
														</li>
														<li>
															<strong>Giottica </strong>- A laser targeted missile
															launcher. 
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														While they don’t last forever, they can be the difference
														between losing and keeping your Exodampers and the Reliquary
														alive. Turret types can quickly be selected by using the default
														ability cast bindings (1-2-3-4 on PC, and RB+ABXY on controller)
														while in the selection screen. Custom bindings for abilities
														will also work! <br>
														 
													</p>

														<strong>EXTERMINATE (HALAKO PERIMETER) &amp; MOBILE DEFENSE (THE
															GREENWAY) </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														In addition to these new mission types, Exterminate and Mobile
														Defense nodes are also available on the Zariman! 
													</p>

													<p>
														In Exterminate, you are tasked with destroying the Corpus or
														Grineer crews that are rummaging around where they shouldn’t be.
														Take on the classic mission type while navigating the
														Void-infested Zariman ship. Not all is the same though, as every
														30 enemies killed will spawn a Thrax enemy-type.
													</p>

													<p>
														In Mobile Defense, you must restore the Zariman’s systems that
														were overcome by the Jump Incident, and defend them while your
														allies purge out the Void. For the Corpus and Grineer, it is key
														that the Zariman stay where it is. They will do everything in
														their power to prevent the Tenno from getting the Zariman’s full
														power back online. Alongside Corpus and Grineer enemies, a
														multiple Thrax enemy-types will come to assist in the fight.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>General Zariman Mission Notes:</strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															All of the Zariman missions are available on the Steel Path
															and reward ‘The Steel Path - The Zariman’ Trophy and Emote! 
															<ul>
																<li>
																	<em>We will be adding a Steel Path toggle to the
																		Zariman Mission Select in the Chrysalith in a
																		hotfix. For now, to turn on/off Steel Path for
																		Zariman missions you will need to do so in the
																		Navigation from your Orbiter first. </em>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															In addition to aborting the mission through the pause menu,
															you can re-enter the elevator and interact with the panel
															inside to ‘Abort Mission’.
															<ul>
																<li>
																	<em>Keep in mind that this option acts exactly the
																		same as aborting a mission from the pause menu
																		in terms of rewards and bonuses. </em>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															Both the Exterminate and Mobile Defense missions have an
															extraction portal that will spawn once you have completed
															the objective. The extraction waypoint will mark its
															location after completing the mission objective. Walking
															into it will send you back to the elevator for extraction.
														</li>

														<strong>INCARNON WEAPONS </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														A collection of Weapons originally used for ceremonial purposes
														have become deadly machines after being affected by the Void.
														They evolve, as does most of what the Void touches. 
													</p>

													<p>
														In the Chrysalith, you’ll meet a character who will teach you
														the ways of these Incarnon Weapons and how to evolve them based
														on challenges you complete in-game. With each Evolution you
														unlock, you can pick your weapon’s upgrades from a variety of
														options, or re-spec as you wish! 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Incarnon Weapons 101: </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>1. Acquire an Incarnon Weapon:</strong></em>
													</p>

													<p>
														Blueprints for the following Incarnon Weapons are available from
														a vendor in the Chrysalith’s Offerings: 
													</p>

													<p>
														<img alt="0db732b0dffedaef21655ffa10454290.jpg" class="ipsImage"

													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>PRAEDOS </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Orokin elites admired farmers in conquered regions, because they
														had learned to fight with modified farming tools despite being
														forbidden to own weapons. For their voyage, the Zariman were
														presented with Praedos in recognition of Zariman tenacity. The
														Void reinforces the strength of the spirited individual by
														fortifying the Praedos.
													</p>

													<p>
														<img alt="2c83b9a1ea518e4159922a9fafbdf5f4.jpg" class="ipsImage"

															src="https://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/2c83b9a1ea518e4159922a9fafbdf5f4.jpg">
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>PHENMOR </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Zariman colonists originally intended to use the Phenmor in
														burial rights. In Orokin society, the higher the rank, the
														greater number of volleys for the deceased. Its stock is carved
														from Phenaureus Pine, a tree designed to release seedlings only
														onto scorched earth. In the hands of the Void, the Phenmor
														becomes darkly aggressive. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<img alt="dc1799d9cf2a1bfefe11d2ba368085ec.jpg" class="ipsImage"

													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>LAETUM</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														During parades and victory marches, the Laetum fired pigmented
														airburst rounds that rained onto festive crowds. The Orokin sent
														Laetum with the Zariman so they could properly celebrate a
														successful maiden voyage to Tau. There would be no such
														celebration, but the Void imbued the Laetum with a much more
														explosive capacity.<br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>2. Unlock Evolutions by Completing
																Challenges:</strong></em>
													</p>

													<p>
														Once you have crafted and equipped an Incarnon Weapon in your
														Arsenal, its Evolution slots and the challenges associated with
														unlocking become visible while viewing it in the Arsenal. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Completing the required challenge unlocks that slot, which can
														then be modified by returning to the vendor in the Chrysalith to
														select the attributes you’d like to apply.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>3. Apply Upgrades to your Incarnon
																Weapon: </strong></em>
													</p>

													<p>
														Visit the vendor in the Chrysalith and select the
														<strong>‘Evolve Incarnon Weapons’ </strong>option.  You must
														have the Incarnon Weapon equipped for you to Evolve it. If you
														have multiple Incarnon Weapons, a selection window will pop up
														for you to choose the weapon you wish to Evolve. If you do not
														have any equipped, you can open the pause menu and select
														‘Arsenal’ while in the Chrysalith to equip them from there
														without having to go back to your Orbiter. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Once you have selected an Incarnon Weapon to evolve, you will be
														presented with this screen: 
													</p>

													<p>
														<img alt="1e5924f4a4b0a7836e28987a1fa74563.jpg" class="ipsImage"
															data-ratio="56.25" height="1080" width="1920"
															src="https://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/1e5924f4a4b0a7836e28987a1fa74563.jpg">
													</p>

													<p>
														There are a total of 5 Evolutions for any Incarnon Weapon. Each
														other these Evolution Slots offer their own set of upgrades to
														unlock. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Evolution I: Incarnon Transmutation </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The first Evolution unlocks the Weapon’s Incarnon Transmutation!
														Which completely alters the look and mechanics of the weapon: 
													</p>

													<p>
														Praedos: <br><img alt="dc3b3423a4310de3b1cf937125122990.jpg"
															class="ipsImage" data-ratio="56.25" height="1080"

													<p>
														Phenmor: <br><img alt="1a4cc35fef04e54b7b8f79cf046a981d.jpg"
															class="ipsImage" data-ratio="56.25" height="1080"

															src="https://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/1a4cc35fef04e54b7b8f79cf046a981d.jpg">
													</p>

													<p>
														Laetum:<br><img alt="321389b4e393ec41ae53f3cc8bbe0163.jpg"
															class="ipsImage" data-ratio="56.25" height="1080"
															width="1920"
															src="https://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/321389b4e393ec41ae53f3cc8bbe0163.jpg">
													</p>

													<p>
														Incarnon Transmutation is achieved by building up charge
														in-mission based on completion of the weapon’s specified task:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Phenmor - Headshots charge Incarnon Transmutation; Alt Fire
															transmutes. 
														</li>
														<li>
															Laetum - Headshot charge Incarnon Transmutation; Alt Fire
															transmutes. 
														</li>
														<li>
															Praedos - Reach 10x Combo and then Heavy Attack to activate
															Incarnon Transmutation. 
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														The task can be viewed by hovering over the Incarnon
														Transmutation slot while viewing the weapon in the Arsenal or in
														the ‘Evolve Incarnon Weapons’ option. 
													</p>

													<p>
														When there is any amount of charge (indicated by the meter in
														the reticle for the Phenmor and Laetum, and a FX pulse on the
														Praedos), Incarnon Transmutation can be activated by using alt
														fire (Phenmor and Laetum) or Heavy Attack (Praedos). That same
														meter will drain as you use the weapon in its Incarnon
														Transmutation. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<img alt="f72462dd1bd257d8939ec3fa24ed3088.png" class="ipsImage"
															data-ratio="28.13" height="540" width="1920"
															src="https://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/f72462dd1bd257d8939ec3fa24ed3088.png">
													</p>

													<p>
														When fully drained it will automatically revert back to its
														default mode. Incarnon Transmutation can also be manually
														reverted at any time by using alt fire again while active.
														Reverting a weapon back from its Incarnon Transmutation will
														expend its remaining charge. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Evolution II - V: Upgrades </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														After unlocking Incarnon Transmutation, the Evolutions that
														follow offer 3 upgrades per slot that are interchangeable and
														can be swapped at any time at the vendor in the Chrysalith. 
													</p>

													<p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>4. Build Around Your Evolution
																Upgrades: </strong></em>
													</p>

													<p>
														Incarnon Weapons can be modded like any other weapon in the
														Arsenal, so build your loadouts around your Evolution upgrades
														and try new combinations for maximum output! 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em>*Note: Stat comparisons for Incarnon Weapons when swapping
															upgrades in the ‘Evolve Incarnon Weapons’ Screen in the
															Chrysalith will be coming in a hotfix. And Incarnon Weapons
															are intentionally skinnable only in their
															<strong>non</strong>-Incarnon Transmutation form. A fix will
															be coming for this in the future. </em><br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>NEW ARCANES</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The Incarnon Weapon vendor in the Chrysalith also offers 10 new
														Arcanes in their Offerings! They also have a chance of dropping
														from defeated Thrax and Void Manifestation enemies.

														<strong>DORMIZONE</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Rebuild a home within the Zariman with your very own
														<strong>Dormizone</strong>! Located in the lower levels of the
														Chrysalith, your humble abode awaits. All players who have
														completed the Angels of the Zariman quest will have their very
														own Dormizone set up with a dining area, tons of shelf space and
														a spacious lounge to hang out in. This new accommodation can be
														accessed from the elevator in the Chrysalith or directly from
														navigation on the Star Chart. 
													</p>

													<p>
														You may recognize the entrance of your apartment from a pivotal
														moment in The New War quest. The Dormizone is similar to the
														Orbiter in that it is your own personal space to customize how
														you see fit. You can bring your favorite decorations from your
														Orbiter and outfit this space and give it your own touch. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em>* Please note that the Orbiter and Dormizone do share your
															decorations inventory so placing an item in one location
															means you cannot also place it in the other unless you have
															more than one of that item.</em>
													</p>

													<p>
														If you are looking for some new things to adorn your abode with
														then you will want to talk to a vendor in the Chrysalith near
														the elevator taking you down to your Dormizone. This vendor
														provides a plethora of Zariman-themed decorations that you can
														get in exchange for Standing. In addition to decorations, this
														Chrysalith vendor carries 15 new Captura scenes featuring
														various areas across the Zariman. The Zariman’s resident
														gardener, ‘Vegetation and Environment Regulation Drone -
														Independent Element’ or <strong>‘VERD-IE’</strong> for short, is
														available as an adorable Skin, Mask, Tail, and Wings for your
														Sentinels. 
													</p>

													<p>
														For those who want the maximum amount of real estate, the
														Chrysalith vendor can give you the key for your own
														observatory-like penthouse called the <strong>Vista
															Suite</strong>. All you need to do is attain the Rank of
														Angel with the new Syndicate and provide the necessary Standing.
													</p>

													<p>
														Dormizones add <strong>four new spaces</strong> to showcase your
														trophies, displays, and more! In addition to the three rooms of
														the Dormizone, you are also free to decorate the landing area
														from where you exit the elevator leading up to and around the
														entrance of your apartment. Similar to your Orbiter, Dormizones
														do have a decoration capacity limit based on the size of each
														space. Did we mention that your Companions can freely roam
														around as well? Bring them with you since they have their own
														place within the Dormizone area and we are sure they would enjoy
														the change in scenery. <br>

													</p>

													<p>
														Unique to the Vista Suite is a window outlook that provides
														exceptional views of space and void energy, but can also be
														customized using interchangeable views called
														<strong>Vistagraphs</strong>. These picturesque scenes can also
														be further enhanced by selecting an <strong>Audioscape
														</strong>to accompany them with. Will you be lost among the
														sounds of the Sands of Mars, or will the tranquility of Oasis
														provide a quiet respite from your battles? Both Vistagraphs and
														Audioscapes can be purchased for Platinum. At launch there will
														be four Vistagraphs and ten Audioscapes to choose from.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Vistagraphs:</strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															The Path Imponderable
														</li>
														<li>
															The Vallis Breathes
														</li>
														<li>
															Impossibility Dawn
														</li>
														<li>
															Silent Blue
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														<strong>Audioscapes:</strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Eidolon Rain
														</li>
														<li>
															Forests of Terra
														</li>
														<li>
															Rock Pillars

														<li>
															Oasis
														</li>
														<li>
															Temple Gates
														</li>
														<li>
															Treacherous Marsh
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														With all this new space to showcase your creativity don’t forget
														to invite your squad over to check out your pad. Players in your
														squad can visit your Dormizone as long as you are the Host and
														they have also completed the Angels of the Zariman quest.
														Dormizones are Host respective, which means that traveling to a
														Dormizone in a squad will land you in the Host’s. When you are
														ready to return to missions or decide to leave the Dormizone,
														then the Host needs to leave to bring the entire squad back to
														the main floor of the Chrysalith or back to your Orbiters. So
														bring your friends, Tenno, and unwind in your new home.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em>*Unlike the [spoiler] Camp or your Orbiter, the Navigation
															menu is not available in the Dormizone. However, you can
															still use the Equipment menu options to access your Arsenal,
															customize your Operator, or even check your Inventory. This
															is truly a place where you want to unwind away from the
															pressures of the Origin System! This is only the beginning
															of your interactions with the Dormizone, Tenno, more will
															come in the future. </em>

														<strong>VOIDSHELL SKINS </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The Void Jump transmogrified lifeforms and materials alike. In
														the Void’s clutches, even threads were imbued with adaptive
														properties. Suddenly, Zariman uniforms seemed to change from
														cloth, to stone, to metal, to liquid and back again as if of
														their own free will. The colonists realized materials had
														manifested new chemical structures, and a character you have yet
														to meet soon learned to control the transformations.
														<strong>Voidshell </strong>imbues cosmetics with the morphic
														material created in the Void Jump.
													</p>

													<p>
														<br>
														Introducing a brand new customization system that allows you to

														<strong>FOCUS SCHOOL SYSTEM REWORK</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Focus School is in session! The Focus System is getting an
														extensive rework to refresh the gameplay potential of Operators,
														movement, School identity and balance.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>WHAT IS FOCUS?</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Focus has been a lot of things over the years. What started in
														2015 as a pivotal decision moment in Warframe’s story has
														continually evolved into its own form of gameplay:<strong>
															Convergence</strong> was introduced alongside Focus Lenses
														to give players an added boost to collecting Focus,
														<strong>Update 22: Plains of Eidolon </strong>shook the system
														up to add new Focus School nodes and Way-Bound abilities, and
														<strong>Update 22.6 </strong>attempted to bring the 5 schools’
														power levels closer together with numerous abilities reworked.
													</p>

													<p>
														At its core, Focus aimed to be an exciting new path to enjoy
														Warframe from the lens of another character. What we’ve come to
														realize over the many years is that there was a lack of true
														synergy between Operator and Warframe. We hope to change that
														while also bringing something fresh to the table!<br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>OPERATOR GAMEPLAY REWORK OVERVIEW</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The <strong>Operator Gameplay</strong> and <strong>Focus
															School</strong> reworks aim to improve the flow between
														Warframe gameplay and Operator gameplay, with the goal of
														encouraging players to swap more frequently between their
														Operator and Warframe to maximize the benefits received from
														both gameplay systems.
													</p>

													<p>
														As with all our major system overhauls, we encourage you to give
														it some time in your own hands before delivering your
														constructive feedback!
													</p>

													<p>
														For Operator Gameplay specifically, these changes come in three
														major ways: first, the introduction of Void Sling; secondly,
														re-engineering Operators to be Client-authoritative to reduce
														jank caused by latency issues related to the mission host;
														thirdly, removal of Void Blast to allow Melee inputs to cause
														automatic Transference from Operator to Warframe.
													</p>

													<p>
														Void Sling is the intended replacement of Void Dashes as a more
														fun and controllable system. In full transparency, the current
														state of sustained Void Dash movement has a spam-centric loop
														that we want to refine. We are very much approaching this like
														how we added Bullet Jump to Parkour: we want movement to be
														king, but better controlled. Current Void Dash does not provide
														easily controlled movement in the typical gameplay spaces. We
														are aiming to strike a balance to ensure good distance can still
														be covered, but some re-mastery will be required of this new
														movement system (much like having to learn Bullet Jumping)!
													</p>

													<p>
														Additionally, Operator Transference has been re-engineered to be
														Client-authoritative to alleviate the common scenario of
														latency. Previously, Transference was Host-authoritative,
														meaning when Clients used Transference the responsiveness was
														determined by the round trip network latency. In order for the
														new Void Sling functionality to be more responsive, the switch
														was made to be Client-authoritative. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Void Dash to Void Sling</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The Operator sends a Void Sling of themselves and then Void
														Slings to it. It is the Operator’s ‘Double Jump’. <strong>*After
															its debut on Devstream #160 and following further
															playtesting, the team has since increased the overall speed
															of the Operator’s Void Sling thanks to feedback.</strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Tap or hold jump while in the air to send out your Sling. A
															tap will travel a minimum distance before the Void Sling. 
														</li>
														<li>
															Void Sling can also be activated using the old Void Dash
															input, by holding jump while in crouched Void Mode.
														</li>
														<li>
															Holding jump sends out the Void Sling further, up to the
															Sling's maximum distance, which upon being reached, will
															automatically Void Sling the player to that space.
														</li>
														<li>
															Letting go of jump before hitting the maximum distance is
															reached will initiate a Void Sling.
														</li>
														<li>
															The Void Sling is sent out in the direction the camera is
															facing once fully charged, or upon release.
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404"
															scrolling="no"
															src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/UnevenOblongHornshark"
															width="640"></iframe>
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Void Blast to Warframe Melee Transfer</strong><br>
														Melee input while using your Operator will now instantly
														Transfer to your Warframe and perform a Melee attack. 
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Having no Melee weapon equipped will result in Transferring
															to your Warframe holding your Primary/Secondary instead.
														</li>
														<li>
															Warframe Melee Finishers can be triggered as Operator with
															‘Use’ input near an unaware or stunned enemy, automatically
															insta-Transferring to Warframe to perform them.
														</li>
														<li>
															So what about Void Blast? It’s been retired and replaced
															with the above. For scenarios where Void Blast is requested
															(disarming Kuva Guardians, etc) using the new Void
															Projection mechanic (or Amps in some cases) will do the
															trick.
															<ul>
																<li>
																	<em>"On Void Blast" Arcanes now trigger on Void
																		Sling.</em>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>FOCUS SCHOOL REWORK</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The Focus School rework aims to boost the lesser used Schools by
														a) giving them more interesting and useful abilities, b)
														defining a clear role and gameplay style for each school, and c)
														incentivizing Warframe-Operator Transference as part of the core
														gameplay loop.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>General Notes:</strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Ability Inputs while in Operator are now used to perform
															brand new Focus School abilities! Each School is launching
															with 2 Abilities, meaning that what you use to cast your
															Warframe’s First and Second Abilities (i.e 1 &amp; 2 keys on
															PC) now have a use while in Operator! 
														</li>
														<li>
															The Pool has been removed! <strong>Any Focus points you’ve
																spent on upgrading your Pool capacity will be returned
																to you in the form of Radiant Eidolon shards, which you
																can convert into Focus points for a School of your
																choosing. </strong>The original intention of the Pool
															was to allow you to select the active nodes within your
															chosen Focus School, but as time went on the Pool only added
															unnecessary complexity for no real gameplay benefit. 
														</li>
														<li>
															Removed passive draining abilities because players would
															typically have deactivated these abilities to avoid the
															passive Energy drain. Any abilities that spend Energy are
															manually triggered as opposed to passively draining.
															<ul>
																<li>
																	<em>As a result, we’ve removed the toggling
																		functionality to have nodes on or off as Pool
																		capacity and passive draining abilities are no
																		longer a factor.</em>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															The Focus School UI has been updated! Not only does the UI
															now apply your chosen UI Theme, but each School screen
															displays a legend of all Way-Bound abilities to easily
															reference the ones you have unlocked. This legend also
															allows you to quickly switch between schools with the click
															of a button. 
														</li>
														<li>
															Fully maxing all the nodes of a Focus School will grant you
															access to <strong>Represent</strong>. Rep your School with
															all new cosmetics (purchased with Focus points) via the
															Represent button in the respective Focus School’s screen. 
														</li>
														<li>
															As an additional way to earn Focus, Enemies that require
															using the Operator to kill them now have a chance to grant
															Focus towards your active School!
															<ul>
																<li>
																	<em>Please note that this Focus gained from new
																		enemies aboard the Zariman does not currently
																		show in the End of Mission screen. This fix will
																		come with our next Mainline build.</em>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															<strong>Transference Static </strong>(dying while the
															Operator) has been reworked as well. The Transference Static
															when dying as the Operator now has increasing consequences.
															A majority of the Focus Rework is to bring synergy between
															Operator and Warframe that ideally allows for less
															Transference Static overall. The consequences are as
															follows:
															<ul>
																<li>
																	First Operator death - 20% Warframe Health reduction
																</li>
																<li>
																	Second Operator death - 50% Warframe Health
																	reduction
																</li>
																<li>
																	Third Operator death - 80% Warframe Health reduction
																</li>
																<li>
																	Fourth Operator death - straight into Warframe
																	pre-death state
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															Several new animations for Operator abilities have been
															added to fit the changes.
														</li>
														<li>
															All Amps are now not silent by default (except for Mote Amp,
															Shwaak Prism, Rahn Prism, Cantic Prism and the Sirocco). 
														</li>
														<li>
															Increased the amount of Affinity converted to Focus from
															Convergence Orbs from 8x to 10x. 
														</li>
														<li>
															The War Within tutorial stages have been updated to
															accommodate these changes. 
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														<em>*All the values below for Focus School nodes are shown at
															max rank.</em>
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>MADURAI</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														The Madurai way follows the path of Engage the Enemy.<strong>
															Speed</strong> and <strong>savagery</strong> characterized
														the Madurai school. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Madurai’s abilities focus on granting that offensive edge in
														combat with a combination of Damage increases, weapon
														efficiency, and Speed enhancements to recklessly attack your
														foes.
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															6 new Focus abilities.
															<ul>
																<li>
																	POWER TRANSFER (Passive)
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			100% Amp Critical Damage for 20s on
																			switching to Operator. 50% Casting Speed on
																			switching to Warframe.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
																<li>
																	VOID FUEL
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			40% Weapon Efficiency for Operator and
																			Warframe while Void Strike is active.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
																<li>
																	CHAINED SLING
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			50% Energy Efficiency on Consecutive Void
																			Slings.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
																<li>
																	SLING STRENGTH
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			Switching to Warframe after a Chained Sling
																			adds 40% Ability Strength for 20s.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
																<li>
																	CONTAMINATION WAVE (Second Ability input)
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			Second Ability emits a Void wave lasting 2s
																			that drenches enemies with Void
																			Contamination making them 50% more
																			vulnerable to Operator Damage for 20s.
																			<ul>
																				<li>
																					<em>Added a mark FX similar to Ash's
																						Bladestorm for Contamination
																						Wave. Each contamination level
																						will display its own marker
																						above enemies.</em>
																				</li>
																			</ul>
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
																<li>
																	DISTILLED CONTAMINATION
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			Killing an enemy affected by Contamination
																			Wave makes all affected enemies 25% more
																			vulnerable, while also making the effect
																			last 10s longer. Maximum 4 stacks.
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															Eternal Gaze and Inner Gaze remain unchanged.
														</li>
														<li>
															Reworked Void Strike: 
															<ul>
																<li>
																	It is now the First Ability input.
																</li>
																<li>
																	<em>First Ability consumes all Operator energy to
																		increase damage for 8s. Deal 10% additional
																		damage for every percentage of Operator energy
																		consumed. 40s cooldown.</em>
																	<ul>
																		<li>
																			<em>eg. 100% of Energy consumed is 1000%
																				damage.</em>
																		</li>
																		<li>
																			<em>Why: Old Void Strike’s long charge up
																				time didn’t provide an ideal gameplay
																				experience within the fast paced
																				environment. Players found themselves
																				sitting in Void Mode waiting for the
																				Damage bonus to build up. Now Void
																				Strike no longer needs Void Mode and has
																				instant damage on input. Additionally,
																				Void Strike is Duration based now
																				instead of per shot, meaning damage gets
																				applied to all pellets of a shotgun for
																				instance.</em>
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															Tweaked Phoenix Talons:
															<ul>
																<li>
																	Physical Damage and Operator Damage increased by
																	30%.
																</li>
																<li>
																	<em>Why: Adding the additional Operator Damage
																		allows for benefits for both Warframe and
																		Operator in the name of synergy. </em><br>
																	 
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														<strong>UNAIRU </strong>

													<p>
														The Unairu push themselves to Outlast The Enemy. Those who
														mastered the Unairu school are granted enhanced damage<strong>

													<p>
														Unairu’s main pillar aims to make Unairu a proper tank Focus
														School with increased Armor, and opportunities for increased
														immunity and survivability. 
													</p>

														<strong>Focus Refund &amp; Re-spec</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Upon login, all Focus points will need to be re-spec’d. You will
														be met with 2 types of Focus Refunds in order to execute this:
													</p>

													<ol>
														<li>
															All your Focus points will be returned to their respective
															School. 
															<ul>
																<li>
																	<em>I.e. my 5,000,000 Focus points I put into
																		Madurai will be returned to that School for me
																		to freely re-spec how I want.</em>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															Any Focus points you’ve spent on upgrading your Pool
															capacity will be returned to you in the form of Radiant
															Eidolon shards via Inbox, which you can convert into Focus
															points for a School of your choosing.
														</li>
													</ol>
													<p>
														While re-investing your Focus into the updated Focus Nodes, you
														might see a difference in Node costs and School costs depending
														on which Way you follow. Overall, the total Focus required
														should be very similar (if not slightly cheaper) than the old
														system, but costs are now standardized across Schools and Nodes.
														When re-spec’ing, make sure you use your old Pool investment
														that was refunded via Radiant Shards, as the previous Pool cost
														has been rolled into the new Node values.
													</p>

													<p>
														If you had maxed out a School before this update, you should be
														able to now as well using the re-spec’d Focus points and
														refunded Radiant Shards -- or at least very close to it, as some
														Schools (ex: Vazarin and Naramon) used to be cheaper than
														others.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>To recap, if you have invested in the Focus system, upon
															login you will receive an inbox message with the
															following: </strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Focus points from every Focus node you invested in. 
														</li>

														<strong>EXIMUS REBORN </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														We have reworked one of our oldest foes in the game: Eximus
														units! Introduced in Update 12, Eximus units were added as
														‘Enemy Leaders,’ meant to bolster their allies with improved
														stats and support abilities. While that core design intention
														still rings true, we felt it was time they were given a refresh
														to bring them up to speed both in terms of their gameplay and
														their appearance in-game. Dress for success, especially when
														you’re a top enemy in the field. 
													</p>

													<p>
														We’ve also put together a handy Dev Workshop video that provides
														a broad overview of the changes listed here:
													</p>

													<div class="ipsEmbeddedVideo" contenteditable="false">
														<div>
															<iframe
																allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
																allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="113"
																src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/OS4f5tn6vb8?feature=oembed"
																width="200"></iframe>
														</div>
													</div>

													<p>
														The main objective of this Eximus Rework is to make them stand
														out more in battle, both in how they function and in how
														formidable they are to face against. We aim to achieve this in 2
														ways: 
													</p>

													<ol>
														<li>
															Amplify their threat with increased time-to-kill -
															accompanied with justifying rewards!
														</li>
														<li>
															Enhancing their visual and mechanical functions to be more
															identifiable in combat.
														</li>
													</ol>
													<p>
														These two shifts for Eximus units should make them more
														challenging to kill, but also make their specific threats easier
														to identify, giving players a more tactical way to evade them. 
													</p>

													<p>
														To amplify the Eximus threat and increase the time-to-kill we’ve
														made tweaks to their:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Warframe power resistances - which we are calling
															<strong>Overguard</strong>
														</li>
														<li>
															Health, Shield, &amp; Armor scaling
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														Currently, the different Eximus types have slightly different
														resistances and combat advantages. For instance, Arson Eximus
														will reduce Fire Damage taken; Leech Eximus will add extra
														Puncture Damage to its damage dealt. These stat changes are
														invisible to a player and don’t really have any noticeable
														impact on gameplay. Instead of keeping unique but forgettable
														specific resistances to Eximus units, we’re adding a new
														universal type of Eximus resistance and tweaking the way their
														Health, Shields &amp; Armor scale across the board to turn them
														into more formidable adversaries. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Warframe Power Resistance: Introducing
															Overguard</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Eximus units now have a new kind of defense called<strong>
															Overguard</strong>, which is a new Health pool on top of
														their regular stats that a) must be removed before players can
														take down their Health/Shields, and b) offers additional
														immunities to the Eximus, making them a priority target
														in-missions.
													</p>

													<p>
														While Overguard is active, it will keep Eximus units immune to
														Warframe crowd control abilities and anything that will stagger,
														knockdown, stun, mind control, ragdoll, and blind. Additionally,
														Overguarded enemies will be unaffected by Radiation Status
														Effects and will be susceptible to a maximum of 4 Cold Status
														Effects at one time. However, Overguard is particularly
														susceptible to Void damage (including Xaku’s Xata’s Whisper),
														which will overall improve the flow and synergy between Warframe
														and Operator combat flow when engaging with Eximus units. This
														will encourage you to engage with them more interactively as
														opposed to easily overpowering them with abilities alone. It
														should shift the focus of fighting Eximus units to using a
														mixture of weapons and teamwork, and make Eximus units feel like
														more of a true threat to Warframes. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Overguard is an additive amount independent of Enemies
														Health/Shield scaling, and is indicated with a bar overtop of
														their existing Health/Shields. With the goal of making Eximus
														units more consistent in terms of difficulty, Overguard will
														scale by level but will be the same amount across all Eximus
														enemy types. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<img alt="17dca8f860ce7e40c5ef761e7b53d98a.png" class="ipsImage"
															data-ratio="55.65" height="532" width="956"
															src="https://n9e5v4d8.ssl.hwcdn.net/uploads/17dca8f860ce7e40c5ef761e7b53d98a.png">
													</p>

													<p>
														Once an Eximus has their Overguard taken out, they will be fully
														susceptible to crowd control abilities. Once taken out,
														Overguard does not regenerate! An important note for Hound
														Companions Null Audit functionality: Hounds will now copy Eximus
														Auras, as opposed to stealing. If an Eximus with active
														Overguard is struck by a Hound wielding a copied Eximus ability,
														they will strip the Eximus’ Overguard by 50%.
													</p>

													<p>
														Overguard was introduced as a means to make Eximus units feel
														more formidable, while also providing Tenno a way to crush their
														defenses with some solid teamwork and concentrated firepower. 
													</p>

													<p>
														With the addition of Overguard, we’ve updated the scope of which
														abilities are considered to be crowd control. Note that these
														abilities will still do their intended damage -- it is only the
														crowd-control effect of the abilities that won’t apply while
														Overguard is present.

													<p>
														<em><strong>Limbo’s Rift &amp; Eximus</strong></em><br>
														Limbo can still send Eximus to the Rift plane where their damage

														<li>
															<em>Originally the Workshop listed ‘Limbo's Rift &amp;

													</ul>
													<p>
														<strong>Overguard: Banshee's Silence</strong><br>
														Banshee's Silence will now negate any active Eximus abilities

														Toxin Clouds from Venomous Eximus, or the Arctic Dome from the
														Arctic Eximus will all be disabled.

														<strong>Overguard: Ancient Healers</strong><br>
														Currently, Ancient Healers provide a 90% damage reduction to
														their allies in range and increased resistance to crowd control
														abilities. Visually, this is only indicated by a pulsing glow on
														buffed enemies in range. This is often confusing if you don’t
														already know that the crowd control resistance and damage
														reduction is being applied from Ancient Healers. 
													</p>

													<p>
														We have changed Ancient Healers to provide allies in range with
														Overguard that is applied at 9x their overall Health.  This
														value simply matches the current level of damage reduction and
														crowd control resistance provided by Ancient Healers, but with
														Overguard it will now provide a clear visual indicator that the
														enemies are being boosted by their Ancient ally!
													</p>

													<p>
														Overguard can be taken out on enemies bolstered by Ancient
														Healers through a few different ways: 
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Dealing damage to Overguard 
														</li>
														<li>
															Killing the Ancient Healer providing Overguard
														</li>
														<li>
															Drawing them out of range from the Ancient Healer
															<ul>
																<li>
																	<em>Currently, any enemy that receives an Overguard
																		buff from an Ancient Healer is one time only,
																		they cannot receive Overguard again when back in
																		range or from a new enemy Healer.</em>
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														Unlike Ancient Healer Eximus, non-Eximus Ancient Healers provide
														Overguard to allies in range but do not have it themselves.
														Overguard from Ancient Healers will not apply and stack with
														innate Eximus Overguard. Also, friendly Ancient Healers (such as
														Specters) will not be providing Overguard on players in this
														rework, but this functionality may come in a future update! <br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Health, Shield &amp; Armor scaling</strong><br>
														Health, Shields, and Armor for Eximus now all scale faster at
														higher levels up to a point, where it eventually flattens out
														and doesn’t scale exponentially, giving them a boost to their
														overall tankiness. Our intent here is to give a slight boost to
														enemies like Butchers more than Heavy Gunners, and to make
														difficulty more consistent across enemy types. A Heavy Gunner
														will still be tougher than a Butcher might be, but the gap
														between the two will be much closer than if it was affected by a
														traditional flat multiplier. Across the board, this should make
														the difficulty of any given Eximus more consistent regardless of
														enemy type. Note these changes are only for Eximus units, their
														regular counterparts will retain the same scaling tech. 
													</p>

													<p>
														Armor will also have a similar method of scaling, by boosting
														low-armored enemies more than high-armored enemies it will help
														close that difficulty gap between enemy types. For enemies
														without Armor, they will get additional Health and Shields
														outside of the regular Eximus scaling to compensate. 
													</p>

													<p>
														As a result, Eximus overall should feel beefier, scale faster at
														a higher level, and be more consistent across different enemy
														types.
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>Visual &amp; Mechanical Enhancements: </strong><br>
														We also want to make Eximus stand out more, so we gave unique
														visual identifiers for each type of Eximus! They now each have
														their own blend of distinct audio and visual FX that will help
														you identify them more easily in combat, and also give you a
														better way to recognize their Eximus type and tactically evade
														their abilities. As a general note for Eximus, they will only
														spawn their Eximus effect once they’ve been alerted to combat.
														For those Tenno that prefer stealth gameplay, this is a great
														opportunity to get a stealth finisher on an unalerted Eximus to
														take them out before they pose a threat. <br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Supported Eximus Type per Faction:</strong><br>
														We’ve made changes to widen the eligibility pool of certain
														Eximus types - all with supporting casting animations:
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>General Pool for all Factions: Arctic, Blitz, Energy
															Leech, Leech, and Shock<br><em>Corpus Specific:</em>
														</strong>Guardian<br><strong><em>Grineer Specific:</em>
														</strong>Arson<br><em><strong>Infested Specific:
															</strong></em>Venomous
													</p>

													<p>
														Corrupted versions will use the same pools as their original
														faction (so Corrupted Ancients could use Venomous, and Corrupted
														Lancer could use Arson). Additionally, Roller Eximus will now be
														available as only Energy Leech or Health Leech Eximus due to
														gameplay functionality. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Archwing Eximus</strong><br>
														Archwing Eximus units will not receive Overguard. It is mainly
														being excluded because Archwing combat is more limited in the
														ways that you’d be able to take out Overguard. Archwing gear
														itself does slightly less damage than its ground counterpart and
														has a smaller pool of crowd control abilities. Overall, we
														believe it to be a better fit to simply update the Eximus
														abilities and effects, but leave Overguard for the ground
														Eximus.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>New Eximus Mercy Functionality</strong><br>
														As a part of the Eximus Rework, we have also updated the
														condition to Mercy Kill certain Eximus that did not have this in
														the past! 
													</p>

													<p>
														Here is a list of the new Eximus types that can be finished with
														Mercy Kills: 
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Mutalist MOA’s
														</li>
														<li>
															Amalgam MOA’s
														</li>
														<li>
															Deimos Carnis
														</li>
														<li>
															Crawlers
														</li>
														<li>
															Nox
														</li>
														<li>
															Embattor MOA’s
														</li>
														<li>
															Amalgam Heqit 
														</li>
														<li>
															Amalgam Machinist 
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														In addition, we have fixed all Crawler Eximus units so they can
														now cast their respective Eximus abilities! Watch out for your
														toes, Tenno. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Below is a list of each Eximus type and a comparison
																of their current vs reworked versions:</strong></em>
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>BLITZ / VOLATILE </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404"
															scrolling="no"
															src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/UltimateObeseBrownbear"
															width="640"></iframe>
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Was</strong></em><br>
														A Seismic Shockwave knockdown with short range.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>NEW</strong></em><br>
														Blitz Eximus units now summon a frontal chain Blast attack by
														slamming their fist into the ground, applying a knockdown and
														Blast Status Effect. This Blast attack is signaled by an audio
														cue and FX of the oncoming Blast erupting from below.
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><em><strong>Visual Changes</strong></em><br>
														Blitz Eximus units are now covered in crackling energy, with the
														addition of small staggered explosions coming from their limbs.
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>ENERGY LEECH / PARASITIC </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404"
															scrolling="no"
															src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/ConsciousHatefulBlackfish"
															width="640"></iframe>
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Was</strong></em><br>
														An invisible aura that drains Energy over time.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>NEW</strong></em><br>
														Energy Leech and Parasitic Eximus units now periodically spawn
														an Energy Leech Zone near the player. The Energy Leech Zone is
														detonated within seconds, draining a large amount of Energy if
														not tactically avoided. This Zone is identified by an expanding
														energy zone and audible cue on placement &amp; detonation.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Visual Changes</strong></em><br>
														Energy Leech and Parasitic Eximus units now appear shrouded in
														Void-like energy, manifesting in short tendrils swirling from
														their body. The Energy Leech Zone spawns with a matching energy
														style and appearance before imploding in a burst.  
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>ARSON / CAUSTIC </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404"
															scrolling="no"
															src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/ScentedBeneficialBlacknorwegianelkhound"
															width="640"></iframe>
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Was</strong></em><br>
														A concussive Fire Blast attack that knockdowns and damages
														enemies caught in its wake.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>NEW</strong></em><br>
														Arson Eximus units maintain a Fire Blast attack, but you can now
														counter the Fire Blast by simply rolling through it to negate
														its oncoming effect. However, Damage is now higher along with a
														forced Heat Status Effect when struck.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Visual Changes</strong></em><br>
														Arson Eximus units are now completely engulfed in roaring
														flames. They occasionally send out these deadly flames in all
														directions as a slow rolling burst. The Fire Blast attack has
														been visually refreshed to not only match the fire FX engulfing
														the Eximus unit, but also to represent a “roaring wave” of fire
														as opposed to a blinding wall.
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>GUARDIAN</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404"
															scrolling="no"
															src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/SecretKindlyAmazontreeboa"
															width="640"></iframe>
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Was</strong></em><br>
														A radial shield charge pulse for allied enemies in range. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>NEW</strong></em><br>
														Guardian Eximus now provide significant damage reduction to its
														allies (your enemies!), which is indicated by a collection of
														smaller shields circling around them.The Guardian Eximus units
														have 3 rotating shields that fully block incoming damage on
														themselves, and also create a similar visual effect on nearby
														allies that applies a Damage Reduction buff on them. This damage
														reduction does not affect VIP enemies such as Demolysts, Capture
														targets, or Bosses, and does not stack with other friendly
														Guardian Eximus. However, it will affect other Eximus units
														within a range! Additionally, Guardian Eximus will only spawn
														their Shields when alerted. For the stealthy Tenno, sneak up on
														them and use a finisher before their defenses are up! 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Important Note on Guardian Eximus related to AOE
															attacks: </strong><br>
														Guardian eximus shields are immune to punch through,  and
														Guardians have very high resistance to AOE damage for themself.
														 Units protected by the Guardian's aura are not immune to punch
														through nor do they have any special resistance to AOE, just the
														generic 90% resistance to everything.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Visual Changes</strong></em><br>
														Guardian Eximus units now exhibit 3 large blue rotating shields.
														These shields have visible gaps between them, offering multiple
														opportunity windows to shoot your foe. Allies with Overguard
														applied now display a simpler version of the shields with
														similar rendering but with a different shape to avoid confusion.
														The smaller shields on buffed allies do not physically block
														damage like their Eximus counterpart, but act as a visual
														indicator that Damage reduction is being applied. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Corpus Guardian Eximus exclusion: Ospreys </strong><br>
														We are omitting Corpus Ospreys from Guardian Eximus eligibility
														for a couple reasons. With their impenetrable rotating shields,
														Guardian Eximus are more susceptible to melee attacks - which
														are far trickier to land on flying Ospreys. Similarly, Mercy
														attacks are one of the best ways to take down an Eximus, which
														can’t be executed on Ospreys. Simply put, we felt having Ospreys
														as Guardian Eximus felt too challenging without the familiar
														takedown tactics available. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>ARCTIC /  FROZEN</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Was</strong></em><br>
														A large protective globe of ice. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>NEW</strong></em><br>
														No changes.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Visual Changes</strong></em><br>
														The globe does the job already!
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>LEECH / SANGUINE</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404"
															scrolling="no"
															src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/LimitedAngelicKouprey"
															width="640"></iframe>
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Was</strong></em><br>
														Life steal from player on damage, but this is negligible due to
														the scale of Player vs enemy Health.
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>NEW</strong></em><br>
														Similar to their Energy counterparts, Leech Eximus now spawn
														Health Leech Zones which tick away at your Health shortly after
														spawning, healing nearby enemies. Players need to avoid the
														Zones to avoid the effect!
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Visual Changes</strong></em><br>
														Leech Eximus units glow red with a pulsing vortex of energy
														generated from its core. The Eximus sends out a small zone of
														the same energy which quickly pulses as it drains a portion of
														your Health. Killing the Eximus or downing it into a Mercy state
														will disrupt any active health leech zones.
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>SHOCK / BIO-ELECTRIC (new) </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404"
															scrolling="no"
															src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/SphericalConventionalBlackbird"
															width="640"></iframe>
													</p>

													<p>
														We have added a new Eximus variant by allowing Infested enemies
														to now become imbued with electric energy! Introducing:
														Bio-Electric Eximus, the newest Infested Eximus threatens to
														shock any Tenno to their senses if they fail to evade the
														Infested Eximus or their lethal homing electric orbs. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Was</strong></em><br>
														A small electrical Damage Over Time area. This is difficult to
														notice until hit with an Electric Status Effect. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>NEW</strong></em><br>
														Shock Eximus/Bio-Electric Eximus spawn 3 electrical orbs that
														will hover in place for a few seconds, dealing increasing
														electrical damage around the Eximus before being released and
														homing in on the Player. The damage from these electrical orbs
														scale with level and deal sustained electric damage when chained
														to you, but no longer deal an Electric Status Effect. Killing
														the Eximus or putting it into a Mercy state will destroy any
														active Orbs. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Visual Changes</strong></em><br>
														Shock Eximus have mini versions of the electrical orbs orbiting
														around them, while they also appear to be covered and crackling
														with electricity.
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>VENOMOUS </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														<iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="404"
															scrolling="no"
															src="https://gfycat.com/ifr/FoolhardyFancyCurassow"
															width="640"></iframe>
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Was</strong></em><br>
														A small Toxin area. Similar to shock Eximus, but Toxin damage is
														more lethal since it lingers on players. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>NEW</strong></em><br>
														Venomous Eximus units become surrounded by a swirling volume of
														Toxic gas upon being alerted. Coming into contact with the gas
														will inflict a Toxin Status Effect. Now, only enemy melee units
														can become venomous Eximus units. Stay clear of their impending
														noxious fumes! 
													</p>

													<p>
														<em><strong>Visual Changes</strong></em><br>
														Venomous Eximus are tightly shrouded in toxic fumes. Upon being
														alerted, these fumes expand into a zone surrounding the Eximus
														in a deadly haze. 
													</p>

													<p>
														<br><strong>REWARDS</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														To accompany the increased threat from Eximus units, we’ve
														further boosted the Affinity gained from killing them by +200%.
														Additionally, Eximus units now drop Credits and Endo at an
														increased rate. This will consistently scale as well for their
														Steel Path counterparts on top of the usual rare chance of a
														Riven Sliver! 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:</strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Considering Eximus enemies are now more formidable, that
															strength is amplified when encountering Eximus units in a
															pack. To help counter that in different parts of Warframe
															we’ve made the following changes: 
															<ul>
																<li>
																	There will be 50% less Eximus on ‘Eximus Stronghold’
																	Sortie conditions
																</li>
																<li>
																	Syndicate Death Squad/Platoon sizes have been

																		</li>
																		<li>
																			-2 of disfavor Platoons reduced from 10-15
																			to 5-7
																			<ul>
																				<li>
																					<em>We have increased the drop

																			</ul>
																		</li>
																	</ul>
																</li>
																<li>
																	Additionally, we have greatly reduced the additional
																	Health and Shields these Units receive
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															Syndicate Exmus Specters have also had their respective
															Eximus type updated: Here are the following Eximus Specters

																<li>
																	Roller Eximus: Energy Leech 
																</li>
																<li>
																	Shield Osprey Eximus: Shock 
																</li>
															</ul>
														</li>
														<li>
															Warden Eximus units in Rescue missions have not received
															these new Eximus upgrades, to ensure they are just as easy
															to stealthily remove as before.
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														<em>Caution Tenno, there’s a heavy unit approaching... </em><br>
														 
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>New Player Experience: Quality Of Life Changes</strong>
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Completing the Heart of Deimos quest will now reward you
															with the Voidrig Blueprint,  Voidrig Weapon Blueprint,
															Voidrig Capsule Blueprint, Voidrig Engine Blueprint, and
															Voidrig Casing Blueprint in the post-quest Inbox.
															<ul>
																<li>
																	<em>As a follow up to our Necramech Drop Rate &amp;

														<strong>Clan Recruitment Changes </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Do you hear that Tenno? Maroo is calling. She’s got some great
														intel on where to find new Clan members. We have added some new
														features to Clan recruitment to supplement finding Clans and
														attracting new members.
													</p>

													</p>

													<p>
														Clans can now post ads by visiting Maroo in her Bazaar or
														accessing their Clan Menu and paying Maroo an administrative fee
														using resources from your Clan Vault. Each week, Maroo will be
														in need of a different resource for her own ‘endeavors’ and in
														exchange she will put the word out for you. These ads will
														appear in the updated Clan Menu under ‘Search for Clan’.

													</p>

													<p>
														Clans can leave a brief description about their Clan’s interests
														and also add flags to help prospective members filter ads. These
														flags include:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															Beginner Friendly
														</li>
														<li>
															High MR Requirement

															Endurance Run Squads
														</li>
														<li>
															Fashion Frame
														</li>
														<li>
															Multiple Languages
														</li>
													</ul>
													<p>
														Clan ads are displayed for 8 hours and then expire. During this
														time, prospective members can apply for a Clan and send a
														message to anyone with the new ‘Advertiser’ role for review and
														approval. If your Clan reaches maximum member capacity while
														your ad is live then your ad will be hidden until it expires or
														if you are no longer at capacity. If you apply to multiple
														Clans, then the first Clan to accept you will be your new family
														and all other applications will be immediately withdrawn.
													</p>

													<p>
														Like many other areas where you are able to provide a custom
														message, players can report a Clan ad if it violates any of our
														<a href="https://www.warframe.com/terms" rel="external nofollow"
															target="_blank">Terms of Service</a>, <a

														<strong>Maggot Decorations</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														A new Decoration has arrived and we are crawling with
														excitement. Nidus’ Maggot is now available in the Market as a
														Decoration for your Orbiter. You can adopt this adorable
														Infested creeper today and watch as it scuttles around. When we
														released Nidus Prime Access back on September 8th, 2021 we had
														originally hoped to include the prime versions of his Infested
														creepers as an additional ship Decoration. 
													</p>

													<p>
														For those Tenno who purchased the Parasitic Link Pack, Ravenous
														Pack, and Nidus Prime Accessories Pack on PC, we will be
														delivering by script the Prime version of Nidus’ Maggot. Due to
														how Prime Access &amp; Prime Accessories are offered on
														consoles, to ensure parity those who purchased the Parasitic
														Link or Prime Accessories will receive 1 Prime Maggot and those
														who purchased the Ravenous Pack will receive 2 Prime Maggots via
														this script. These packs will also be updated for future
														purchases to include the Prime Maggot Decoration.
													</p>

													<p>
														<strong>Audio Reverb Changes: </strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Our sound team has made several changes to reverb across the
														game thanks to a new system! This nifty new tech automatically
														places reverb in level zones instead of the hand placing that
														used to happen in every tile. This allows us to get better
														results because it takes into account area size and area
														materials. It also includes preset reverb containers that can
														have more types of reverb that are better suited to each area. 
													</p>

													<p>
														For example: A small, narrow vent space that opens to a small
														room that then opens to a larger room can each have their own
														custom reverb based on the size and material type of each room.
														Instead of hand placing each of the three reverbs, the engine is
														now smart enough to take into account each of the rooms
														automatically. This allows for greater specificity because it
														measures the size of each room. 
													</p>

													<p>
														This also has a performance benefit, as it enables only the
														required reverb sample to be loaded as needed, instead of
														loading all of them when a level first loads. This ultimately
														saves memory and allows the levels to load a bit faster! <br>
														 
													</p>

														<strong>DirectX 12 Performance and Optimizations:</strong>
													</p>

													<p>
														Ongoing work continues on our DirectX12 render mode! 
													</p>

													<p>
														In this update, DirectX 12 runs up to 25% faster than it used to
														for high performance PCs. Most modern systems will run the game
														in DirectX 12 mode significantly faster than DirectX 11!
													</p>

													<p>
														Comparing the same scene across different versions of the game
														to compare how the rendering modes compare:
													</p>

													<ul>
														<li>
															New War DX11: 110 fps
														</li>
														<li>
															New War DX12: 141 fps
														</li>
														<li>
															Angels of Zariman DX12: <strong>177 fps</strong>
														</li>
													</ul>

		ANGELS OF THE ZARIMAN QUEST 
	 
	
	
		The Zariman Ten Zero cries out into the endless darkness that surrounds it. In a post-New War world, something lingers in the Void-ridden ship once inhabited by the Tenno. Its wailing can be heard from afar. Return to it, find the source of its song, and unearth the memories echoing throughout the vacant corridors. 
	 
	
	
		Quest Prerequisite: You must have The New War quest completed in order to unlock the Angels of the Zariman quest in your Codex.  
		If you have not completed The New War, check out our helpful guide: https://www.warframe.com/news/preparing-for-angels-of-the-zariman-en
	 
	
	
		Similar to the Saya’s Vigil, Vox Solaris, and Heart of Deimos quests, this is a solo gameplay-focused experience that will introduce you to key characters and Zariman related content. 
	 
	
	
		Completing the quest will reward you with gifts from the Void in your Inbox!   
		Once you have completed the Angels of the Zariman quest, the following gameplay options will become available for you to start venturing deeper into the ship: 
	 
	
	
			Zariman Bounties 
		 
		
			3x New Missions Types 
		 
	
		*More detailed information on the above is provided in their own sections below. 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		NEW TILESET: ZARIMAN 
	 
	
	
		Go back to where it all began, Tenno. The horrors of the past that took place on the Zariman Ten Zero may be overshadowed by the phantasmic energies that now reside there. 
	 
	
	
		Characterized by its overgrown state and constant flow of Void energy, it has taken a new form. Between the golden figures and trinkets littered around from before the Void-Jump accident, the Void pulses through its veins, twisting and bending the Zariman to its will. The accident left the ship in disarray, with many nooks and crannies that can be discovered and explored. 
	 
	
	
		Explore with caution, Tenno -- even though you may recognize areas from your past, everything is not what it seems. 
	 
	
	
		The Zariman appears in the Star Chart after completing The New War quest, but is only accessible after completing the Angels of the Zariman quest. 
	 
	
	
		Optimization Tip for PC Players:
	 
	
	
		Be advised that the Zariman tileset is optimized for and looks best with the ‘Enhanced’ Graphics Engine option enabled. We recommend you switch to this under the ‘Video’ tab in Options if your system can handle it to enjoy the finer details of this lush new map!  
		 
	 
	
	
		Zariman Tileset Resources:
	 
	
	
		Ferrite, Alloy Plate, Voidgel Orb (NEW), Entrati Lanthorns (NEW), and Thrax Plasm are dropped from enemies and can be found in Resource Deposits around the Zariman tileset.  
	 
	
	
		These new resources can also be fed to Helminth. 
	 
	
	
		Voidplumes:
	 
	
	
		Voidplumes are tokens shed from Void Manifestations which can be used for many things, including:
	 
	
	
			Turned in for Standing in the Chrysalith for a new Syndicate.
		 
		
			Used in certain crafting recipes. 
		 
		
			Used to purchase Voidplume decorations and Kuva from a new vendor’s supplies in the Chrysalith. 
		 
	
		Voidplumes can be earned as Bounty rewards. They can also be found scattered around the Zariman tileset in a similar fashion to Syndicate Medallions. Each mission spawns 8 Voidplumes for keen-eyed Tenno to find! A prompt will appear letting you know how many more Plumes can be found in-mission after picking one up. 
	 
	
	
		Similar to Medallions, there are various tiers with different Standing values: higher tiers of Voidplumes can be earned by killing special Void manifestation enemies or from Melica Caches, while lower tiers can be found in-mission and from Bounty drop tables. Listed below are the tiers from lowest to highest: 
	 
	
	
			Voidplume Down
		 
		
			Voidplume Vane
		 
		
			Voidplume Quill
		 
		
			Voidplume Crest
		 
		
			Voidplume Pinion
		 
	
		 
	
	
		Melica Caches &amp; Zarium Accolades: 
	 
	
	
		Zarium Accolades are required to open new caches locked by Cephalon Melica - whom you may remember from your time in the classroom. Melica Caches are marked for your convenience when you’re nearby. To unlock the Melica Cache, you will need to locate a Zarium Accolade  - keep an ear out for their distinct sound, or use Loot Radar! Once you find a Zarium Accolade, you can pick them up and bring them to the Melica Console to unlock a Voidplume Quill within.
	 
	
	
		Melica Caches appear only once the Angels of the Zariman quest is complete, they cannot be found during the quest. 
	 
	
	
		New Somachord Fragments: 
	 
	
	
		Hunt down and scan Somachord Tones throughout the Zariman tileset to unlock 3 new tracks:
	 
	
	
			On Corroded Wings
		 
		
			The Offering
		 
		
			Canticle
		 
	
		 
	
	
		NEW ENEMIES 
	 
	
	
		The Zariman brings with it new threats. Aboard the ship you will go toe to toe with the following fresh-faced foes: 
	 
	
	
		Kuva Trokarian 
		The Worm Queen has bestowed these troopers with a miniature Kuva Trokar to disrupt transference. 
	 
	
	
		Derivator Crewman 
		Using the latest in Corpus weapons technology, this Crewman absorbs damage, until it unleashes it all in a powerful shockwave. The Derivator unit is mounted on the back.
	 
	
	
		Thrax Centurion  
		Equipped with a deadly Scythe, they emanate an energy unknown to us. These mysterious creatures can be found in Zariman missions. 
	 
	
	
		Thrax Legatus 
		Armed and ready with a Rifle, they emanate an energy unknown to us. These mysterious creatures can be found in Zariman missions. 
	 
	
	
		Codename: Void Manifestations  
		Its true name and nature shall be revealed to you soon, Tenno… 
		 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		NEW HUB: CHRYSALITH 
	 
	
	
		A familiar location that was first ventured during The New War, the Chrysalith is at the heart of the Zariman. A sanctuary whose bridged walk paths and vistas were once enjoyed by its original passengers is now repurposed as a hub for returning visitors and warriors fending off against the Grineer, Corpus, and others that lay waiting in the halls of the Zariman. 
	 
	
	
		During the Angels of the Zariman quest, you will be introduced to a band of new characters and a new Syndicate who call the Chrysalith home. After you have completed the quest, you will be able to visit the Chrysalith with other Tenno, as you would Fortuna or Cetus. 
	 
	
	
		The Chrysalith is also the first social hub of its kind that allows you to seamlessly access procedural missions without load screens. Jump between missions without ever having to return to your Orbiter’s Navigation.   
	 
	
	
		While inside the Chrysalith, opening the map will display what enemy faction is currently active within the Zariman. Grineer and Corpus squads rotate every 2.5 hours.
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		This is also indicated by the faction ships closing the distance between themselves and the Zariman in the Star Chart. 
	 
	
	
		NEW SYNDICATE
	 
	
	
		A new Syndicate is revealed after completing the Angels of the Zariman quest. Band together with Syndicate members stationed in the Chrysalith and gain access to Bounties, Incarnon Weapons, Dormizone &amp; Voidshell goods, and more!  
	 
	
	
		Work your way through the Ranks from Fallen to Angel, and forge bonds to uncover more about the present predicament of the Zariman. This Syndicate can also be accessed from the Syndicate segment in your Orbiter. 
	 
	
	
		ZARIMAN BOUNTIES
	 
	
	
		Once you have completed the Quest, Bounties become available from within the Chrysalith! These Bounties offer additional challenges for players looking to show their Mastery of the mission types on the Zariman - you will need to bring the best gear for the job! Players can play through the regular versions of these missions from the Star Chart, or opt for the Bounty version for different rewards and Syndicate standing. The Bounty versions are intended to be much more challenging! 
	 
	
	
		Bounties are structured with a distinct objective that must be completed before the player can extract -- or in certain cases can cause a mission failure if the player is unsuccessful. Upon mission completion, players also earn Voidplumes in addition to the Bounty drop table rewards The higher the difficulty, the harder the challenge, the more Plumes are given! 
	 
	
	
		Bounty Rewards: 
	 
	
	
		The following possible rewards can be earned by playing the Bounties:
	 
	
	
			Gyre’s Blueprint and Component Blueprints 
		 
		
			Alternox Blueprint (New Primary Weapon)
		 
		
			Hespar Blueprint (New Heavy Scythe)
		 
		
			Aeolak Blueprint (New Primary Rifle)
		 
		
			New Resources:
			
					Entrati Lanthorn - A ceremonial beacon used to map Void locations onto real space. 
				 
				
					Voidgel Orb - A sample of ambient Void energy distilled into a neutral state. 
				 
				
					Thrax Plasm - Found in the remnants of Thrax Void manifestations, this plasm has several surprisingly practical applications.
				 
			 
		
			Voidplumes:    
			
					Voidplume Down
				 
				
					Voidplume Vane
				 
				
					Voidplume Quill
				 
				
					Voidplume Crest
				 
			 
		
			Credits, Endo, Greater Focus Lenses, Ayatan Amber Star, and Relics!  
			 
		 
	
		NEW MISSIONS TYPES 
	 
	
	
		The Zariman brings with it three new endless mission types: Void Flood, Void Cascade, and Void Armageddon. These missions offer new enemies and challenges! Accompanying these are Exterminate and Mobile Defense mission nodes set in the new Zariman tileset. After completing the Angels of the Zariman Quest, you can start these missions from the Star Chart, or by entering the elevator in the Chrysalith and interacting with the Zariman Navigation panel.
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		  
	
	
		The enemies you will face aboard the Zariman depends on which faction have staked their claim on the ship. Word of the time-forgotten riches aboard the Zariman has made its way onto both Corpus and Grineer wavelengths. While only one faction will be aboard the Zariman at a time, you can expect to see even rotations of these factions every 2.5 hours as each one fights to claim their time aboard the fabled Zariman.
	 
	
	
		Base Focus Lenses for each Focus School are in Rotation C of the drop tables for these new endless missions. We wanted to add a new means of earning Lenses in light of all of the Focus changes, while also making later stages of the endless missions worth your while. 
	 
	
	
		 
	 
	
	
		VOID FLOOD (EVERVIEW ARC)
	 
	
	
		Forces born of Void and agony are clawing at the Albrecht membrane, creating Ruptures that saturate areas of the Zariman with Void energy. Introducing Void Flood - a parkour-heavy endless mission focused on maintaining the stability of the Zariman’s Automatic Vitoplast system.
	 
	
	
		How to play:
	 
	
	
		The goal is to mend these Ruptures, and in order to do so you must collect essential Vitoplast on-board the Zariman and deliver it to the location of these Void Ruptures. The amount of Vitoplast you collect is indicated by the floating globe accompanying you as you hunt it down. The globe fills with Vitoplast as it is collected, and drains when you are near a Void Rupture. Void Flood will test your refined parkour skills, as the anti-gravity properties of Vitoplast have them scattered high and low across the Zariman. 
	 
	
	
		Be warned, failure to close the Ruptures flood the Zariman with uncontrollable Void Contamination that can enhance your enemy and hinder your strength in various different ways, or even cause the Vitoplast itself to act erratically. The higher levels of Void Contamination present on the Zariman, the greater the challenge. Contamination levels are indicated in a gauge in the HUD, with three levels of randomized effects that will trigger when hit:
	 
	
	
			First level = 40% 
		 
		
			Second level = 70% 
		 
		
			Final level = 100%
			
					Hitting 100% will start a countdown timer, if the Contamination levels are not lowered by closing Ruptures within that time, players will be forced to extract as the environment has become inhospitable. 
				 
			 
	
		Every three Ruptures sealed summons a Thrax Centurion - a strong foe made of both armor and Void energy looking to keep you from sealing up the Ruptures. Your synergy between Warframe and Operator will be required to take down this quick and relentless enemy. Similar to Eximus Units, Thrax Centurions are imbued with Overguard (more on this in the Eximus Reborn section below) which fortifies their stance. Thrax Centurions also directly reward 2,500 Focus Points of the players’ active Focus School for all of those who are within Affinity range once defeated. 
	 
	
	
		You will have the choice to extract after sealing three Ruptures successfully, which also counts as one full round in this endless mission. 
	 
	
	
		The success and length of your mission is fully dependent on your ability to balance consistent damage with elegant parkour. If you can keep up both to the standards of the Zariman Ten Zero, you will be nobly rewarded.
	 
	
	
		 VOID CASCADE (TUVUL COMMONS)
	 
	
	
		Enemies of the Zariman have caused a great imbalance using the Void energy perforating its walls and manifesting in truly horrifying ways. Introducing Void Cascade -  an endless mission mode where you are tasked with cleansing Void-possessed Exolizers to restore the Zariman’s systems.
	 
	
	
		How to play:
	 
	
	
		The goal is to combat the Void using devices known as Exolizers. But even the advanced Zariman tech cannot resist the Void forever. It’s up to you to purge them of the Void, and fight off a complete and total Cascade. 
	 
	
	
		Exolizers possessed by the Void are protected by it. Your Operator is key in cleansing it to allow the Exolizer to begin its purging process. Possessed and purged Exolizers are tracked in the HUD, alongside the gauge that indicates the level at which the ship is reaching a Cascade-level disaster. 
	 
	
	
		Upon cleansing an Exolizer, Tenno must face a Thrax Centurian which has possessed the machine, but they will not give up without a fight. If they are not killed quickly, it will feed the Cascade by re-possessing another Exolizer and accelerate the chaos. The more you cleanse, the more chaotic it can get - it will require great focus and skill to maintain the Exolizers the longer you stay. 
	 
	
	
		If you’d rather flee the battle and bank your rewards, it will require four successful purged Exolizers to unlock extraction, which also counts as one full round in this endless mission.
	 
	
	
		If players are unable to fend off the Cascade and the gauge reaches 100%, extraction will become available. 
	 
	
	
		Restoring the systems of the Zariman won’t be easy, but is necessary to reclaim the ship. It will require great strength and coordination to quell the Cascade, but those who stay to fight will be compensated for their efforts.  
		 
	 
	
	
		VOID ARMAGEDDON (ORO WORKS)
	 
	
	
		Grineer and Corpus enemies have boarded the Zariman and are targeting its Reliquary for destruction. Exquisitely twisted creations and their minions seek to do the same. Void Armageddon tests your ability to prioritize targets: defend against enemies while protecting the Reliquary aboard the Zariman and the Exodampers that aid you in your objective. Assemble your Arsenal wisely, as this mission is not for the ill-prepared.
	 
	
	
		How to play: 
	 
	
	
		The goal is to defend the Reliquary from the waves of threats that are looking to destroy it. To aid you in your defense are Exodampers. These towers will weaken your enemy while they are active, but if destroyed will strengthen them with randomized buffs until the Exodampers respawn. While not essential, without your Exodampers, your enemy can focus fire on the Reliquary. If your enemies succeed in destroying it, you will be forced to accept defeat and return back to the Chrysalith. As the chaos grows, Void manifestations will attempt to drain the Reliquary using Void energy. You can track how much of the Reliquary has been drained using the percentage icon above it. If the Reliquary is fully drained, you will have failed your mission. Destroyed or drained, you must fight to prevent the Reliquary from meeting either fates.
	 
	
	
		Void Armageddon consists of Rounds and Waves:
	 
	
	
			Waves: Enemies will try to destroy Exodampers in waves. To complete a wave, you must eliminate the squad of enemies sent to the Exodamper.  After each wave, your enemies will begin to attack from a different angle - follow the instructions on your HUD and move swiftly to the next Exodamper to defend. 
		 
		
			Rounds: A full round consists of three waves.  
		 
	
		If you fail to protect your Exodampers, they will remain destroyed until the next round.
	 
	
	
			For clarity - if an Exodamper is destroyed in Wave 1 in Round 1, it will respawn at the start of Round 2, or the 4th Wave in total.
		 
	
		Grineer and Corpus will be the least of your worries the longer you defend, as Void manifestations appear every three waves and will stand in your way between completing rounds. Traditional combat will be necessary to make a dent, but your skills as your Operator are crucial to defeating this foe. If you succeed in this fight, you and your squad (those within Affinity range of the enemy when defeated) will be rewarded with Focus Points as well as a high-tier Voidplume which must be picked up.
	 
	
	
		Completing one round of Void Armageddon will unlock extraction, but enemies will continue to attack until you can fight no longer.
	 
	
	
		You aren’t alone in your efforts. By taking advantage of the Zariman’s built-in defenses, you can utilize strategically placed Armaments - specialized turrets. They can be used to hold off the onslaught of enemies at all angles, but must be constructed first. To build these turrets, locate and capture Argozene Drops, which will provide the Argozene to construct them. To unlock a Drop, you must stand within the indicated zone around it and wait until the box is fully enveloped with energy - at which point it will open and shower you with the crafting material. Argozene is also dropped from fallen enemies. Collected Argozene is shared amongst your squad, so coordinating with them will be required to optimize your strategy. 
	 
	
	
		As long as you have the required Argozene, you can choose from a variety of Armaments to craft:
	 
	
	
			Mazuka - Minigun turret that focuses on one target at a time. 
		 
		
			Faradon - Arc lightning turret that can strike multiple targets at once. 
		 
		
			Corralizer - Trap turret that grabs enemies and pulls them in. 
		 
		
			Giottica - A laser targeted missile launcher. 
		 
	
		While they don’t last forever, they can be the difference between losing and keeping your Exodampers and the Reliquary alive. Turret types can quickly be selected by using the default ability cast bindings (1-2-3-4 on PC, and RB+ABXY on controller) while in the selection screen. Custom bindings for abilities will also work!  
		 
	 
	
	
		EXTERMINATE (HALAKO PERIMETER) &amp; MOBILE DEFENSE (THE GREENWAY) 
	 
	
	
		In addition to these new mission types, Exterminate and Mobile Defense nodes are also available on the Zariman! 
	 
	
	
		In Exterminate, you are tasked with destroying the Corpus or Grineer crews that are rummaging around where they shouldn’t be. Take on the classic mission type while navigating the Void-infested Zariman ship. Not all is the same though, as every 30 enemies killed will spawn a Thrax enemy-type.
	 
	
	
		In Mobile Defense, you must restore the Zariman’s systems that were overcome by the Jump Incident, and defend them while your allies purge out the Void. For the Corpus and Grineer, it is key that the Zariman stay where it is. They will do everything in their power to prevent the Tenno from getting the Zariman’s full power back online. Alongside Corpus and Grineer enemies, a multiple Thrax enemy-types will come to assist in the fight.
	 
	
	
		General Zariman Mission Notes:
	 
	
	
			All of the Zariman missions are available on the Steel Path and reward ‘The Steel Path - The Zariman’ Trophy and Emote! 
			
					We will be adding a Steel Path toggle to the Zariman Mission Select in the Chrysalith in a hotfix. For now, to turn on/off Steel Path for Zariman missions you will need to do so in the Navigation from your Orbiter first. 
				 
			 
		
			In addition to aborting the mission through the pause menu, you can re-enter the elevator and interact with the panel inside to ‘Abort Mission’.
			
					Keep in mind that this option acts exactly the same as aborting a mission from the pause menu in terms of rewards and bonuses. 
				 
			 
		
			Both the Exterminate and Mobile Defense missions have an extraction portal that will spawn once you have completed the objective. The extraction waypoint will mark its location after completing the mission objective. Walking into it will send you back to the elevator for extraction.
		 
	
		INCARNON WEAPONS 
	 
	
	
		A collection of Weapons originally used for ceremonial purposes have become deadly machines after being affected by the Void. They evolve, as does most of what the Void touches. 
	 
	
	
		In the Chrysalith, you’ll meet a character who will teach you the ways of these Incarnon Weapons and how to evolve them based on challenges you complete in-game. With each Evolution you unlock, you can pick your weapon’s upgrades from a variety of options, or re-spec as you wish! 
	 
	
	
		Incarnon Weapons 101: 
	 
	
	
		1. Acquire an Incarnon Weapon:
	 
	
	
		Blueprints for the following Incarnon Weapons are available from a vendor in the Chrysalith’s Offerings: 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		PRAEDOS 
	 
	
	
		Orokin elites admired farmers in conquered regions, because they had learned to fight with modified farming tools despite being forbidden to own weapons. For their voyage, the Zariman were presented with Praedos in recognition of Zariman tenacity. The Void reinforces the strength of the spirited individual by fortifying the Praedos.
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		PHENMOR 
	 
	
	
		Zariman colonists originally intended to use the Phenmor in burial rights. In Orokin society, the higher the rank, the greater number of volleys for the deceased. Its stock is carved from Phenaureus Pine, a tree designed to release seedlings only onto scorched earth. In the hands of the Void, the Phenmor becomes darkly aggressive. 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		LAETUM
	 
	
	
		During parades and victory marches, the Laetum fired pigmented airburst rounds that rained onto festive crowds. The Orokin sent Laetum with the Zariman so they could properly celebrate a successful maiden voyage to Tau. There would be no such celebration, but the Void imbued the Laetum with a much more explosive capacity. 
		 
	 
	
	
		2. Unlock Evolutions by Completing Challenges:
	 
	
	
		Once you have crafted and equipped an Incarnon Weapon in your Arsenal, its Evolution slots and the challenges associated with unlocking become visible while viewing it in the Arsenal. 
	 
	
	
		Completing the required challenge unlocks that slot, which can then be modified by returning to the vendor in the Chrysalith to select the attributes you’d like to apply.
	 
	
	
		3. Apply Upgrades to your Incarnon Weapon: 
	 
	
	
		Visit the vendor in the Chrysalith and select the ‘Evolve Incarnon Weapons’ option.  You must have the Incarnon Weapon equipped for you to Evolve it. If you have multiple Incarnon Weapons, a selection window will pop up for you to choose the weapon you wish to Evolve. If you do not have any equipped, you can open the pause menu and select ‘Arsenal’ while in the Chrysalith to equip them from there without having to go back to your Orbiter. 
	 
	
	
		Once you have selected an Incarnon Weapon to evolve, you will be presented with this screen: 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		There are a total of 5 Evolutions for any Incarnon Weapon. Each other these Evolution Slots offer their own set of upgrades to unlock. 
	 
	
	
		Evolution I: Incarnon Transmutation 
	 
	
	
		The first Evolution unlocks the Weapon’s Incarnon Transmutation! Which completely alters the look and mechanics of the weapon: 
	 
	
	
		Praedos:   
	
	
		Phenmor:   
	
	
		Laetum:  
	
	
		Incarnon Transmutation is achieved by building up charge in-mission based on completion of the weapon’s specified task:
	 
	
	
			Phenmor - Headshots charge Incarnon Transmutation; Alt Fire transmutes. 
		 
		
			Laetum - Headshot charge Incarnon Transmutation; Alt Fire transmutes. 
		 
		
			Praedos - Reach 10x Combo and then Heavy Attack to activate Incarnon Transmutation. 
		 
	
		The task can be viewed by hovering over the Incarnon Transmutation slot while viewing the weapon in the Arsenal or in the ‘Evolve Incarnon Weapons’ option. 
	 
	
	
		When there is any amount of charge (indicated by the meter in the reticle for the Phenmor and Laetum, and a FX pulse on the Praedos), Incarnon Transmutation can be activated by using alt fire (Phenmor and Laetum) or Heavy Attack (Praedos). That same meter will drain as you use the weapon in its Incarnon Transmutation. 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		When fully drained it will automatically revert back to its default mode. Incarnon Transmutation can also be manually reverted at any time by using alt fire again while active. Reverting a weapon back from its Incarnon Transmutation will expend its remaining charge. 
	 
	
	
		Evolution II - V: Upgrades 
	 
	
	
		After unlocking Incarnon Transmutation, the Evolutions that follow offer 3 upgrades per slot that are interchangeable and can be swapped at any time at the vendor in the Chrysalith. 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		You can view your Incarnon Weapons selected upgrades and challenges in your Arsenal. 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		4. Build Around Your Evolution Upgrades: 
	 
	
	
		Incarnon Weapons can be modded like any other weapon in the Arsenal, so build your loadouts around your Evolution upgrades and try new combinations for maximum output! 
	 
	
	
		*Note: Stat comparisons for Incarnon Weapons when swapping upgrades in the ‘Evolve Incarnon Weapons’ Screen in the Chrysalith will be coming in a hotfix. And Incarnon Weapons are intentionally skinnable only in their non-Incarnon Transmutation form. A fix will be coming for this in the future.  
		 
	 
	
	
		NEW ARCANES
	 
	
	
		The Incarnon Weapon vendor in the Chrysalith also offers 10 new Arcanes in their Offerings! They also have a chance of dropping from defeated Thrax and Void Manifestation enemies. 
	 
	
	
		*Stats shown are Rank 5

		DORMIZONE
	 
	
	
		Rebuild a home within the Zariman with your very own Dormizone! Located in the lower levels of the Chrysalith, your humble abode awaits. All players who have completed the Angels of the Zariman quest will have their very own Dormizone set up with a dining area, tons of shelf space and a spacious lounge to hang out in. This new accommodation can be accessed from the elevator in the Chrysalith or directly from navigation on the Star Chart. 
	 
	
	
		You may recognize the entrance of your apartment from a pivotal moment in The New War quest. The Dormizone is similar to the Orbiter in that it is your own personal space to customize how you see fit. You can bring your favorite decorations from your Orbiter and outfit this space and give it your own touch. 
	 
	
	
		* Please note that the Orbiter and Dormizone do share your decorations inventory so placing an item in one location means you cannot also place it in the other unless you have more than one of that item.
	 
	
	
		If you are looking for some new things to adorn your abode with then you will want to talk to a vendor in the Chrysalith near the elevator taking you down to your Dormizone. This vendor provides a plethora of Zariman-themed decorations that you can get in exchange for Standing. In addition to decorations, this Chrysalith vendor carries 15 new Captura scenes featuring various areas across the Zariman. The Zariman’s resident gardener, ‘Vegetation and Environment Regulation Drone - Independent Element’ or ‘VERD-IE’ for short, is available as an adorable Skin, Mask, Tail, and Wings for your Sentinels. 
	 
	
	
		For those who want the maximum amount of real estate, the Chrysalith vendor can give you the key for your own observatory-like penthouse called the Vista Suite. All you need to do is attain the Rank of Angel with the new Syndicate and provide the necessary Standing.
	 
	
	
		Dormizones add four new spaces to showcase your trophies, displays, and more! In addition to the three rooms of the Dormizone, you are also free to decorate the landing area from where you exit the elevator leading up to and around the entrance of your apartment. Similar to your Orbiter, Dormizones do have a decoration capacity limit based on the size of each space. Did we mention that your Companions can freely roam around as well? Bring them with you since they have their own place within the Dormizone area and we are sure they would enjoy the change in scenery.  
		 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		Unique to the Vista Suite is a window outlook that provides exceptional views of space and void energy, but can also be customized using interchangeable views called Vistagraphs. These picturesque scenes can also be further enhanced by selecting an Audioscape to accompany them with. Will you be lost among the sounds of the Sands of Mars, or will the tranquility of Oasis provide a quiet respite from your battles? Both Vistagraphs and Audioscapes can be purchased for Platinum. At launch there will be four Vistagraphs and ten Audioscapes to choose from.
	 
	
	
		Vistagraphs:
	 
	
	
			The Path Imponderable
		 
		
			The Vallis Breathes
		 
		
			Impossibility Dawn
		 
		
			Silent Blue
		 
	
		Audioscapes:
	 
	
	
			Eidolon Rain
		 
		
			Forests of Terra
		 
		
			Rock Pillars
		 
		
			Sands of Mars
		 
		
			Systems Edge
		 
		
			Jungle Spaceport
		 
		
			Mountain Lake
		 
		
			Oasis
		 
		
			Temple Gates
		 
		
			Treacherous Marsh
		 
	
		With all this new space to showcase your creativity don’t forget to invite your squad over to check out your pad. Players in your squad can visit your Dormizone as long as you are the Host and they have also completed the Angels of the Zariman quest. Dormizones are Host respective, which means that traveling to a Dormizone in a squad will land you in the Host’s. When you are ready to return to missions or decide to leave the Dormizone, then the Host needs to leave to bring the entire squad back to the main floor of the Chrysalith or back to your Orbiters. So bring your friends, Tenno, and unwind in your new home.
	 
	
	
		*Unlike the [spoiler] Camp or your Orbiter, the Navigation menu is not available in the Dormizone. However, you can still use the Equipment menu options to access your Arsenal, customize your Operator, or even check your Inventory. This is truly a place where you want to unwind away from the pressures of the Origin System! This is only the beginning of your interactions with the Dormizone, Tenno, more will come in the future. 
	 
	
	
		VOIDSHELL SKINS 
	 
	
	
		The Void Jump transmogrified lifeforms and materials alike. In the Void’s clutches, even threads were imbued with adaptive properties. Suddenly, Zariman uniforms seemed to change from cloth, to stone, to metal, to liquid and back again as if of their own free will. The colonists realized materials had manifested new chemical structures, and a character you have yet to meet soon learned to control the transformations. Voidshell imbues cosmetics with the morphic material created in the Void Jump.

		FOCUS SCHOOL SYSTEM REWORK
	 
	
	
		Focus School is in session! The Focus System is getting an extensive rework to refresh the gameplay potential of Operators, movement, School identity and balance.
	 
	
	
		WHAT IS FOCUS?
	 
	
	
		Focus has been a lot of things over the years. What started in 2015 as a pivotal decision moment in Warframe’s story has continually evolved into its own form of gameplay: Convergence was introduced alongside Focus Lenses to give players an added boost to collecting Focus, Update 22: Plains of Eidolon shook the system up to add new Focus School nodes and Way-Bound abilities, and Update 22.6 attempted to bring the 5 schools’ power levels closer together with numerous abilities reworked.
	 
	
	
		At its core, Focus aimed to be an exciting new path to enjoy Warframe from the lens of another character. What we’ve come to realize over the many years is that there was a lack of true synergy between Operator and Warframe. We hope to change that while also bringing something fresh to the table! 
		 
	 
	
	
		OPERATOR GAMEPLAY REWORK OVERVIEW
	 
	
	
		The Operator Gameplay and Focus School reworks aim to improve the flow between Warframe gameplay and Operator gameplay, with the goal of encouraging players to swap more frequently between their Operator and Warframe to maximize the benefits received from both gameplay systems.
	 
	
	
		As with all our major system overhauls, we encourage you to give it some time in your own hands before delivering your constructive feedback!
	 
	
	
		For Operator Gameplay specifically, these changes come in three major ways: first, the introduction of Void Sling; secondly, re-engineering Operators to be Client-authoritative to reduce jank caused by latency issues related to the mission host; thirdly, removal of Void Blast to allow Melee inputs to cause automatic Transference from Operator to Warframe.
	 
	
	
		Void Sling is the intended replacement of Void Dashes as a more fun and controllable system. In full transparency, the current state of sustained Void Dash movement has a spam-centric loop that we want to refine. We are very much approaching this like how we added Bullet Jump to Parkour: we want movement to be king, but better controlled. Current Void Dash does not provide easily controlled movement in the typical gameplay spaces. We are aiming to strike a balance to ensure good distance can still be covered, but some re-mastery will be required of this new movement system (much like having to learn Bullet Jumping)!
	 
	
	
		Additionally, Operator Transference has been re-engineered to be Client-authoritative to alleviate the common scenario of latency. Previously, Transference was Host-authoritative, meaning when Clients used Transference the responsiveness was determined by the round trip network latency. In order for the new Void Sling functionality to be more responsive, the switch was made to be Client-authoritative. 
	 
	
	
		Void Dash to Void Sling
	 
	
	
		The Operator sends a Void Sling of themselves and then Void Slings to it. It is the Operator’s ‘Double Jump’. *After its debut on Devstream #160 and following further playtesting, the team has since increased the overall speed of the Operator’s Void Sling thanks to feedback.
	 
	
	
			Tap or hold jump while in the air to send out your Sling. A tap will travel a minimum distance before the Void Sling. 
		 
		
			Void Sling can also be activated using the old Void Dash input, by holding jump while in crouched Void Mode.
		 
		
			Holding jump sends out the Void Sling further, up to the Sling&#039;s maximum distance, which upon being reached, will automatically Void Sling the player to that space.
		 
		
			Letting go of jump before hitting the maximum distance is reached will initiate a Void Sling.
		 
		
			The Void Sling is sent out in the direction the camera is facing once fully charged, or upon release.
		 
	
		
	 
	
	
		Void Blast to Warframe Melee Transfer 
		Melee input while using your Operator will now instantly Transfer to your Warframe and perform a Melee attack. 
	 
	
	
			Having no Melee weapon equipped will result in Transferring to your Warframe holding your Primary/Secondary instead.
		 
		
			Warframe Melee Finishers can be triggered as Operator with ‘Use’ input near an unaware or stunned enemy, automatically insta-Transferring to Warframe to perform them.
		 
		
			So what about Void Blast? It’s been retired and replaced with the above. For scenarios where Void Blast is requested (disarming Kuva Guardians, etc) using the new Void Projection mechanic (or Amps in some cases) will do the trick.
			
					&quot;On Void Blast&quot; Arcanes now trigger on Void Sling.
				 
			 
	
		 
	 
	
	
		FOCUS SCHOOL REWORK
	 
	
	
		The Focus School rework aims to boost the lesser used Schools by a) giving them more interesting and useful abilities, b) defining a clear role and gameplay style for each school, and c) incentivizing Warframe-Operator Transference as part of the core gameplay loop.
	 
	
	
		General Notes:
	 
	
	
			Ability Inputs while in Operator are now used to perform brand new Focus School abilities! Each School is launching with 2 Abilities, meaning that what you use to cast your Warframe’s First and Second Abilities (i.e 1 &amp; 2 keys on PC) now have a use while in Operator! 
		 
		
			The Pool has been removed! Any Focus points you’ve spent on upgrading your Pool capacity will be returned to you in the form of Radiant Eidolon shards, which you can convert into Focus points for a School of your choosing. The original intention of the Pool was to allow you to select the active nodes within your chosen Focus School, but as time went on the Pool only added unnecessary complexity for no real gameplay benefit. 
		 
		
			Removed passive draining abilities because players would typically have deactivated these abilities to avoid the passive Energy drain. Any abilities that spend Energy are manually triggered as opposed to passively draining.
			
					As a result, we’ve removed the toggling functionality to have nodes on or off as Pool capacity and passive draining abilities are no longer a factor.
				 
			 
		
			The Focus School UI has been updated! Not only does the UI now apply your chosen UI Theme, but each School screen displays a legend of all Way-Bound abilities to easily reference the ones you have unlocked. This legend also allows you to quickly switch between schools with the click of a button. 
		 
		
			Fully maxing all the nodes of a Focus School will grant you access to Represent. Rep your School with all new cosmetics (purchased with Focus points) via the Represent button in the respective Focus School’s screen. 
		 
		
			As an additional way to earn Focus, Enemies that require using the Operator to kill them now have a chance to grant Focus towards your active School!
			
					Please note that this Focus gained from new enemies aboard the Zariman does not currently show in the End of Mission screen. This fix will come with our next Mainline build.
				 
			 
		
			Transference Static (dying while the Operator) has been reworked as well. The Transference Static when dying as the Operator now has increasing consequences. A majority of the Focus Rework is to bring synergy between Operator and Warframe that ideally allows for less Transference Static overall. The consequences are as follows:
			
					First Operator death - 20% Warframe Health reduction
				 
				
					Second Operator death - 50% Warframe Health reduction
				 
				
					Third Operator death - 80% Warframe Health reduction
				 
				
					Fourth Operator death - straight into Warframe pre-death state
				 
			 
		
			Several new animations for Operator abilities have been added to fit the changes.
		 
		
			All Amps are now not silent by default (except for Mote Amp, Shwaak Prism, Rahn Prism, Cantic Prism and the Sirocco). 
		 
		
			Increased the amount of Affinity converted to Focus from Convergence Orbs from 8x to 10x. 
		 
		
			The War Within tutorial stages have been updated to accommodate these changes. 
		 
	
		*All the values below for Focus School nodes are shown at max rank.
	 
	
	
		MADURAI
	 
	
	
		The Madurai way follows the path of Engage the Enemy. Speed and savagery characterized the Madurai school. 
	 
	
	
		Madurai’s abilities focus on granting that offensive edge in combat with a combination of Damage increases, weapon efficiency, and Speed enhancements to recklessly attack your foes.
	 
	
	
			6 new Focus abilities.
			
					POWER TRANSFER (Passive)
					
							100% Amp Critical Damage for 20s on switching to Operator. 50% Casting Speed on switching to Warframe.
						 
					 
				
					VOID FUEL
					
							40% Weapon Efficiency for Operator and Warframe while Void Strike is active.
						 
					 
				
					CHAINED SLING
					
							50% Energy Efficiency on Consecutive Void Slings.
						 
					 
				
					SLING STRENGTH
					
							Switching to Warframe after a Chained Sling adds 40% Ability Strength for 20s.
						 
					 
				
					CONTAMINATION WAVE (Second Ability input)
					
							Second Ability emits a Void wave lasting 2s that drenches enemies with Void Contamination making them 50% more vulnerable to Operator Damage for 20s.
							
									Added a mark FX similar to Ash&#039;s Bladestorm for Contamination Wave. Each contamination level will display its own marker above enemies.
								 
							 
					 
				
					DISTILLED CONTAMINATION
					
							Killing an enemy affected by Contamination Wave makes all affected enemies 25% more vulnerable, while also making the effect last 10s longer. Maximum 4 stacks.
						 
					 
			 
		
			Eternal Gaze and Inner Gaze remain unchanged.
		 
		
			Reworked Void Strike: 
			
					It is now the First Ability input.
				 
				
					First Ability consumes all Operator energy to increase damage for 8s. Deal 10% additional damage for every percentage of Operator energy consumed. 40s cooldown.
					
							eg. 100% of Energy consumed is 1000% damage.
						 
						
							Why: Old Void Strike’s long charge up time didn’t provide an ideal gameplay experience within the fast paced environment. Players found themselves sitting in Void Mode waiting for the Damage bonus to build up. Now Void Strike no longer needs Void Mode and has instant damage on input. Additionally, Void Strike is Duration based now instead of per shot, meaning damage gets applied to all pellets of a shotgun for instance.
						 
					 
			 
		
			Tweaked Phoenix Talons:
			
					Physical Damage and Operator Damage increased by 30%.
				 
				
					Why: Adding the additional Operator Damage allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy.  
					 
				 
			 
	
		UNAIRU 
	 
	
	
		The Unairu push themselves to Outlast The Enemy. Those who mastered the Unairu school are granted enhanced damage resistance and damage reflection.
	 
	
	
		Unairu’s main pillar aims to make Unairu a proper tank Focus School with increased Armor, and opportunities for increased immunity and survivability. 
	 
	
	
			8 new Focus Abilities.
			
					POISE
					
							Gain immunity to slow, stagger, and knockdown effects for 40s after Transferring between Operator or Warframe.
						 
					 
				
					LAST GASP (Passive, Way-Bound)
					
							Revive your Warframe by Transferring to Operator and killing enemies before the Revive Meter drains, 15s. Each kill filles the Revive Meter by 30%.
						 
					 
				
					VENGEANCE (Passive, Way-Bound)
					
							During Last Gasp, Operator Damage is increased by 100% plus an additional 25% per second.
						 
					 
				
					MAGNETIC FLARE (First Ability input)
					
							Use First Ability to create a 8m radius field that lasts for 30s and disables the shields of any enemy that enters it.
						 
					 
				
					CAUSTIC STRIKE (Second Ability input)
					
							Second Ability launches an energy bomb that explodes with a 8m radius, stripping 100% of enemy armor. Tap Second Ability again to detonate in-flight.
						 
					 
				
					MAGNETIC BOOST
					
							Void Sling out of a Magnetic Flare to refresh its duration and increase its radius by 100%.
						 
					 
				
					REINFORCED RETURN

					STATIC PURGE
					
							100% chance to clear Transference Static on kill while Reinforced Return is active. 
						 
					 
			 
		
			Reworked Unairu Wisp:
			
					100% chance to summon an Unairu Wisp for each enemy hit by Sundering Dissipation that will seek out the nearest ally within Affinity Range and increase their Operator damage by 100% for 20 secs.
					
							Why: Its new coexistence alongside another Focus ability unifies the 2 together to add another layer that benefits both Warframe and Operator. It also removes having to pick up the Unairu Wisp manually, and will instead find you within Affinity Range. 
						 
					 
			 
		
			Tweaked Stone Skin:
			
					Increases Armor for Warframe and Operator by 200.
					
							Why: Adding the additional Operator Armor allows for benefits for both Warframe and Operator in the name of synergy. 
						 
					 
			 
	
		 
	 
	
	
		ZENURIK
	 
	
	
		The Zenurik believed the clearest path to victory was to Dominate the Enemy. Those who master the Zenurik school believe that sheer strength could erase any resistance. 
	 
	
	
		Rest assured the core of Energizing Dash remains as-is with some slight updates. Our goal is to bring other Focus Schools up to the level of Zenurik while still maintaining the School’s tactical benefits.
	 
	
	
			6 new Focus Abilities:
			
					HARDENED WELLSPRING (First Ability input)
					
							Tap First Ability inside a Wellspring to increase its size, boost its duration by 20s, and grant 20% Ability Strength to those inside.

							Killing a disarmed enemy increases Operator energy regen rate by 10% for 10s. 4 Max Stacks.
						 
					 
				
					INNER MIGHT (Passive)
					
							Allows Abilities to be cast without using Energy or Shields but requires 60s to recharge.  
						 
					 
			 
		
			Void Flow, Void Siphon, and Energy Pulse remain unchanged. 
		 
		
			Energizing Dash is now Wellspring with the slight change of being a direct input Ability (First Ability input) as opposed to a Void Dash.
			
					This also affects Necramechs.
				 
			 
	
		NARAMON
	 
	
	
		The Naramon discipline focuses on Knowing The Enemy. They believed that to truly understand a foe would confer the greatest advantage upon a warrior.
	 
	
	
		True to its focus in the art of assault, Naramon continues to heavily lean towards a Melee support role with speed and distance enhancements.
	 
	
	
			7 new Focus Abilities.  
			
					OPENING SLAM
				 
				
					Performing a Slam as Operator switches to Warframe and grants double Combo gain for 20s.

					FAR SLING (Passive)
					
							Increases maximum Void Sling distance by 30%.
						 
					 
			 
		
			Mind Step remains unchanged. 
		 
		
			Power Spike and Affinity Spike have switched places so that Power Spike is now the starting node.
			
					Slight increase to Melee Affinity gained from Affinity Spike.  
					 
				 
			 
	
		VAZARIN
	 
	
	
		The Vazarin are trained to Counter The Enemy. Those who mastered the Vazarin school maintain constant awareness in order to defend against all aggression. 
	 
	
	
		The Vazarin Focus School aims to now be a proper support School in both life and death. 
	 
	
	
			6 new Focus Abilities: 
			
					VOID REGEN
					
							Void Mode starts healing at +10 Health per second, increasingly by 10 per second up to a maximum of 50.
						 
					 
				
					SQUAD REGEN
					
							When Void Regen reaches its maximum, it is applied to Operators within the Affinity Range for 40s.
						 
					 
				
					VOID SNARE (Second Ability input)
					
							Second Ability launches a projectile that spins up a vortex trap on impact, or tap Second Ability again to detonate in-flight. Trap lasts 8s. Void Sling through trapped enemies to grant yourself and allies within Affinity Range 100 Health.

							When Guardian Shell breaks, Warframe Shield Regeneration rate is increased by 150% and Regeneration Delay is reduced by 90%, for 8s. 
						 
					 
			 
		
			Enduring Tides and Mending Unity remain unchanged.
		 
		
			Tweaked Rejuvenating Tides: 
			
					Effect is doubled while controlling your Warframe.
					
							Why: Additional benefit between using both Warframe and Operator.
						 
					 
			 
		
			Tweaked Mending Soul:
			
					The first 4 Revives are instantaneous. Additional Revives are 100% faster.
					
							Why: Players would often remark that the ability eventually became useless in longer missions. Mending Soul retains its immediate strengths, but once used up, now offers a more permanent benefit! 
						 
					 
			 
	
		 
	 
	
	
		Focus Refund &amp; Re-spec
	 
	
	
		Upon login, all Focus points will need to be re-spec’d. You will be met with 2 types of Focus Refunds in order to execute this:
	 
	
	
			All your Focus points will be returned to their respective School. 
			
					I.e. my 5,000,000 Focus points I put into Madurai will be returned to that School for me to freely re-spec how I want.
				 
			 
		
			Any Focus points you’ve spent on upgrading your Pool capacity will be returned to you in the form of Radiant Eidolon shards via Inbox, which you can convert into Focus points for a School of your choosing.
		 
	
		While re-investing your Focus into the updated Focus Nodes, you might see a difference in Node costs and School costs depending on which Way you follow. Overall, the total Focus required should be very similar (if not slightly cheaper) than the old system, but costs are now standardized across Schools and Nodes. When re-spec’ing, make sure you use your old Pool investment that was refunded via Radiant Shards, as the previous Pool cost has been rolled into the new Node values.
	 
	
	
		If you had maxed out a School before this update, you should be able to now as well using the re-spec’d Focus points and refunded Radiant Shards -- or at least very close to it, as some Schools (ex: Vazarin and Naramon) used to be cheaper than others.
	 
	
	
		To recap, if you have invested in the Focus system, upon login you will receive an inbox message with the following: 
	 
	
	
			Focus points from every Focus node you invested in. 
		 
		
			Refunded Brilliant Eidolon Shards
			
					Based on the number of Way-Bound nodes unlocked.
				 
			 
		
			Refunded Radiant Eidolon Shards 
			
					Based on the amount of points invested in Pool upgrades.
				 
			 
		
			(BONUS) 5x Lua Focus Lenses:
			
					1x Lua Unairu Lens
				 
				
					1x Lua Naramon Lens
				 
				
					1x Lua Zenurik Lens
				 
				
					1x Lua Vazarin Lens
				 
				
					1x Lua Madurai Lens

		EXIMUS REBORN 
	 
	
	
		We have reworked one of our oldest foes in the game: Eximus units! Introduced in Update 12, Eximus units were added as ‘Enemy Leaders,’ meant to bolster their allies with improved stats and support abilities. While that core design intention still rings true, we felt it was time they were given a refresh to bring them up to speed both in terms of their gameplay and their appearance in-game. Dress for success, especially when you’re a top enemy in the field. 
	 
	
	
		We’ve also put together a handy Dev Workshop video that provides a broad overview of the changes listed here:
	 
	
	
		
			
		
	
	
	
		The main objective of this Eximus Rework is to make them stand out more in battle, both in how they function and in how formidable they are to face against. We aim to achieve this in 2 ways: 
	 
	
	
			Amplify their threat with increased time-to-kill - accompanied with justifying rewards!
		 
		
			Enhancing their visual and mechanical functions to be more identifiable in combat.
		 
	
		These two shifts for Eximus units should make them more challenging to kill, but also make their specific threats easier to identify, giving players a more tactical way to evade them. 
	 
	
	
		To amplify the Eximus threat and increase the time-to-kill we’ve made tweaks to their:
	 
	
	
			Warframe power resistances - which we are calling Overguard
		 
		
			Health, Shield, &amp; Armor scaling
		 
	
		Currently, the different Eximus types have slightly different resistances and combat advantages. For instance, Arson Eximus will reduce Fire Damage taken; Leech Eximus will add extra Puncture Damage to its damage dealt. These stat changes are invisible to a player and don’t really have any noticeable impact on gameplay. Instead of keeping unique but forgettable specific resistances to Eximus units, we’re adding a new universal type of Eximus resistance and tweaking the way their Health, Shields &amp; Armor scale across the board to turn them into more formidable adversaries. 
	 
	
	
		Warframe Power Resistance: Introducing Overguard
	 
	
	
		Eximus units now have a new kind of defense called Overguard, which is a new Health pool on top of their regular stats that a) must be removed before players can take down their Health/Shields, and b) offers additional immunities to the Eximus, making them a priority target in-missions.
	 
	
	
		While Overguard is active, it will keep Eximus units immune to Warframe crowd control abilities and anything that will stagger, knockdown, stun, mind control, ragdoll, and blind. Additionally, Overguarded enemies will be unaffected by Radiation Status Effects and will be susceptible to a maximum of 4 Cold Status Effects at one time. However, Overguard is particularly susceptible to Void damage (including Xaku’s Xata’s Whisper), which will overall improve the flow and synergy between Warframe and Operator combat flow when engaging with Eximus units. This will encourage you to engage with them more interactively as opposed to easily overpowering them with abilities alone. It should shift the focus of fighting Eximus units to using a mixture of weapons and teamwork, and make Eximus units feel like more of a true threat to Warframes. 
	 
	
	
		Overguard is an additive amount independent of Enemies Health/Shield scaling, and is indicated with a bar overtop of their existing Health/Shields. With the goal of making Eximus units more consistent in terms of difficulty, Overguard will scale by level but will be the same amount across all Eximus enemy types. 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		Once an Eximus has their Overguard taken out, they will be fully susceptible to crowd control abilities. Once taken out, Overguard does not regenerate! An important note for Hound Companions Null Audit functionality: Hounds will now copy Eximus Auras, as opposed to stealing. If an Eximus with active Overguard is struck by a Hound wielding a copied Eximus ability, they will strip the Eximus’ Overguard by 50%.
	 
	
	
		Overguard was introduced as a means to make Eximus units feel more formidable, while also providing Tenno a way to crush their defenses with some solid teamwork and concentrated firepower. 
	 
	
	
		With the addition of Overguard, we’ve updated the scope of which abilities are considered to be crowd control. Note that these abilities will still do their intended damage -- it is only the crowd-control effect of the abilities that won’t apply while Overguard is present.
	 
	
	
			Sevagoth’s Gloom
		 
		
			Chroma’s Effigy: Sentry
		 
		
			Xaku’s The Lost
			
					Gaze
				 
				
					Deny
					
							If Overguard is active, enemies will not be put into aerial Stasis
						 
					 
				
					Accuse
					
							No longer changes faction of enemies if immune to Mind Control, such as when Overguard is active 
						 
					 
				
					Note: These changes to The Lost also apply to other Crowd Control Immune enemies 
				 
			 
		
			Garuda’s Seeking Talons
		 
		
			Mirage’s Sleight of Hand
		 
		
			Mirage’s Prism
		 
		
			Khora’s Ensnare 
		 
		
			Volt’s Discharge 
		 
		
			Baruuk’s Lull
		 
		
			Harrow’s Condemn
		 
		
			Excalibur’s Radial Blind 
		 
		
			Ivara’s Quiver: Sleep arrow
		 
		
			Revenant’s Reave
		 
		
			Revenant’s Mesmer Skin
		 
		
			Inaros’ Desiccation 
		 
		
			Yareli’s Sea Snares
		 
		
			Limbo&#039;s Banish
			
					Eximus ignore the knockdown effect of Banish while Overguard is active, however they can still be sent to the Rift plane regardless of Overguard 
				 
			 
		
			Limbo’s Stasis
		 
	
		Keep in mind that this list is not exhaustive to all Warframe abilities that Overguard is resistant to, simply ones that we are now considering Crowd Control as of this update.  
		 
	 
	
	
		Limbo’s Rift &amp; Eximus 
		Limbo can still send Eximus to the Rift plane where their damage will be avoided, but Eximus Abilities will now ignore the Rift plane. 
	 
	
	
			Originally the Workshop listed ‘Limbo&#039;s Rift &amp; Cataclysm’ to now be considered CC, but this was not an accurate description. Limbo can still send Eximus to the Rift plane while Overguard is active.
		 
	
		Overguard: Banshee&#039;s Silence 
		Banshee&#039;s Silence will now negate any active Eximus abilities and prevent any Eximus abilities from being cast while it is active. Guardian Eximus Shields (and their AOE resistance), Toxin Clouds from Venomous Eximus, or the Arctic Dome from the Arctic Eximus will all be disabled.
	 
	
	
			Note: the friendly 90% damage reduction Aura from Guardian Eximus, and the Arctic Eximus slow aura will not be disabled by Silence (This may be subject to change!) 
		 
	
		Overguard: Ancient Healers 
		Currently, Ancient Healers provide a 90% damage reduction to their allies in range and increased resistance to crowd control abilities. Visually, this is only indicated by a pulsing glow on buffed enemies in range. This is often confusing if you don’t already know that the crowd control resistance and damage reduction is being applied from Ancient Healers. 
	 
	
	
		We have changed Ancient Healers to provide allies in range with Overguard that is applied at 9x their overall Health.  This value simply matches the current level of damage reduction and crowd control resistance provided by Ancient Healers, but with Overguard it will now provide a clear visual indicator that the enemies are being boosted by their Ancient ally!
	 
	
	
		Overguard can be taken out on enemies bolstered by Ancient Healers through a few different ways: 
	 
	
	
			Dealing damage to Overguard 
		 
		
			Killing the Ancient Healer providing Overguard
		 
		
			Drawing them out of range from the Ancient Healer
			
					Currently, any enemy that receives an Overguard buff from an Ancient Healer is one time only, they cannot receive Overguard again when back in range or from a new enemy Healer.
				 
			 
	
		Unlike Ancient Healer Eximus, non-Eximus Ancient Healers provide Overguard to allies in range but do not have it themselves. Overguard from Ancient Healers will not apply and stack with innate Eximus Overguard. Also, friendly Ancient Healers (such as Specters) will not be providing Overguard on players in this rework, but this functionality may come in a future update!  
		 
	 
	
	
		Health, Shield &amp; Armor scaling 
		Health, Shields, and Armor for Eximus now all scale faster at higher levels up to a point, where it eventually flattens out and doesn’t scale exponentially, giving them a boost to their overall tankiness. Our intent here is to give a slight boost to enemies like Butchers more than Heavy Gunners, and to make difficulty more consistent across enemy types. A Heavy Gunner will still be tougher than a Butcher might be, but the gap between the two will be much closer than if it was affected by a traditional flat multiplier. Across the board, this should make the difficulty of any given Eximus more consistent regardless of enemy type. Note these changes are only for Eximus units, their regular counterparts will retain the same scaling tech. 
	 
	
	
		Armor will also have a similar method of scaling, by boosting low-armored enemies more than high-armored enemies it will help close that difficulty gap between enemy types. For enemies without Armor, they will get additional Health and Shields outside of the regular Eximus scaling to compensate. 
	 
	
	
		As a result, Eximus overall should feel beefier, scale faster at a higher level, and be more consistent across different enemy types.
	 
	
	
		 Visual &amp; Mechanical Enhancements:  
		We also want to make Eximus stand out more, so we gave unique visual identifiers for each type of Eximus! They now each have their own blend of distinct audio and visual FX that will help you identify them more easily in combat, and also give you a better way to recognize their Eximus type and tactically evade their abilities. As a general note for Eximus, they will only spawn their Eximus effect once they’ve been alerted to combat. For those Tenno that prefer stealth gameplay, this is a great opportunity to get a stealth finisher on an unalerted Eximus to take them out before they pose a threat.  
		 
	 
	
	
		Supported Eximus Type per Faction: 
		We’ve made changes to widen the eligibility pool of certain Eximus types - all with supporting casting animations:
	 
	
	
		General Pool for all Factions: Arctic, Blitz, Energy Leech, Leech, and Shock Corpus Specific: Guardian Grineer Specific: Arson Infested Specific: Venomous
	 
	
	
		Corrupted versions will use the same pools as their original faction (so Corrupted Ancients could use Venomous, and Corrupted Lancer could use Arson). Additionally, Roller Eximus will now be available as only Energy Leech or Health Leech Eximus due to gameplay functionality. 
	 
	
	
		Archwing Eximus 
		Archwing Eximus units will not receive Overguard. It is mainly being excluded because Archwing combat is more limited in the ways that you’d be able to take out Overguard. Archwing gear itself does slightly less damage than its ground counterpart and has a smaller pool of crowd control abilities. Overall, we believe it to be a better fit to simply update the Eximus abilities and effects, but leave Overguard for the ground Eximus.
	 
	
	
		New Eximus Mercy Functionality 
		As a part of the Eximus Rework, we have also updated the condition to Mercy Kill certain Eximus that did not have this in the past! 
	 
	
	
		Here is a list of the new Eximus types that can be finished with Mercy Kills: 
	 
	
	
			Mutalist MOA’s
		 
		
			Amalgam MOA’s
		 
		
			Deimos Carnis
		 
		
			Crawlers
		 
		
			Nox
		 
		
			Embattor MOA’s
		 
		
			Amalgam Heqit 
		 
		
			Amalgam Machinist 
		 
	
		In addition, we have fixed all Crawler Eximus units so they can now cast their respective Eximus abilities! Watch out for your toes, Tenno. 
	 
	
	
		Below is a list of each Eximus type and a comparison of their current vs reworked versions:
	 
	
	
		BLITZ / VOLATILE 
	 
	
	
		
	 
	
	
		Was 
		A Seismic Shockwave knockdown with short range.
	 
	
	
		NEW 
		Blitz Eximus units now summon a frontal chain Blast attack by slamming their fist into the ground, applying a knockdown and Blast Status Effect. This Blast attack is signaled by an audio cue and FX of the oncoming Blast erupting from below.
	 
	
	
		 Visual Changes 
		Blitz Eximus units are now covered in crackling energy, with the addition of small staggered explosions coming from their limbs.  
	 
	
	
		 ENERGY LEECH / PARASITIC 
	 
	
	
		
	 
	
	
		Was 
		An invisible aura that drains Energy over time.
	 
	
	
		NEW 
		Energy Leech and Parasitic Eximus units now periodically spawn an Energy Leech Zone near the player. The Energy Leech Zone is detonated within seconds, draining a large amount of Energy if not tactically avoided. This Zone is identified by an expanding energy zone and audible cue on placement &amp; detonation.
	 
	
	
		Visual Changes 
		Energy Leech and Parasitic Eximus units now appear shrouded in Void-like energy, manifesting in short tendrils swirling from their body. The Energy Leech Zone spawns with a matching energy style and appearance before imploding in a burst.  
	 
	
	
		 ARSON / CAUSTIC 
	 
	
	
		
	 
	
	
		Was 
		A concussive Fire Blast attack that knockdowns and damages enemies caught in its wake.
	 
	
	
		NEW 
		Arson Eximus units maintain a Fire Blast attack, but you can now counter the Fire Blast by simply rolling through it to negate its oncoming effect. However, Damage is now higher along with a forced Heat Status Effect when struck.
	 
	
	
		Visual Changes 
		Arson Eximus units are now completely engulfed in roaring flames. They occasionally send out these deadly flames in all directions as a slow rolling burst. The Fire Blast attack has been visually refreshed to not only match the fire FX engulfing the Eximus unit, but also to represent a “roaring wave” of fire as opposed to a blinding wall.
	 
	
	
		 GUARDIAN
	 
	
	
		
	 
	
	
		Was 
		A radial shield charge pulse for allied enemies in range. 
	 
	
	
		NEW 
		Guardian Eximus now provide significant damage reduction to its allies (your enemies!), which is indicated by a collection of smaller shields circling around them.The Guardian Eximus units have 3 rotating shields that fully block incoming damage on themselves, and also create a similar visual effect on nearby allies that applies a Damage Reduction buff on them. This damage reduction does not affect VIP enemies such as Demolysts, Capture targets, or Bosses, and does not stack with other friendly Guardian Eximus. However, it will affect other Eximus units within a range! Additionally, Guardian Eximus will only spawn their Shields when alerted. For the stealthy Tenno, sneak up on them and use a finisher before their defenses are up! 
	 
	
	
		Important Note on Guardian Eximus related to AOE attacks:  
		Guardian eximus shields are immune to punch through,  and Guardians have very high resistance to AOE damage for themself.  Units protected by the Guardian&#039;s aura are not immune to punch through nor do they have any special resistance to AOE, just the generic 90% resistance to everything.
	 
	
	
		Visual Changes 
		Guardian Eximus units now exhibit 3 large blue rotating shields. These shields have visible gaps between them, offering multiple opportunity windows to shoot your foe. Allies with Overguard applied now display a simpler version of the shields with similar rendering but with a different shape to avoid confusion. The smaller shields on buffed allies do not physically block damage like their Eximus counterpart, but act as a visual indicator that Damage reduction is being applied. 
	 
	
	
		Corpus Guardian Eximus exclusion: Ospreys  
		We are omitting Corpus Ospreys from Guardian Eximus eligibility for a couple reasons. With their impenetrable rotating shields, Guardian Eximus are more susceptible to melee attacks - which are far trickier to land on flying Ospreys. Similarly, Mercy attacks are one of the best ways to take down an Eximus, which can’t be executed on Ospreys. Simply put, we felt having Ospreys as Guardian Eximus felt too challenging without the familiar takedown tactics available. 
	 
	
	
		ARCTIC /  FROZEN
	 
	
	
		Was 
		A large protective globe of ice. 
	 
	
	
		NEW 
		No changes.
	 
	
	
		Visual Changes 
		The globe does the job already!
	 
	
	
		 LEECH / SANGUINE
	 
	
	
		
	 
	
	
		Was 
		Life steal from player on damage, but this is negligible due to the scale of Player vs enemy Health.
	 
	
	
		NEW 
		Similar to their Energy counterparts, Leech Eximus now spawn Health Leech Zones which tick away at your Health shortly after spawning, healing nearby enemies. Players need to avoid the Zones to avoid the effect!
	 
	
	
		Visual Changes 
		Leech Eximus units glow red with a pulsing vortex of energy generated from its core. The Eximus sends out a small zone of the same energy which quickly pulses as it drains a portion of your Health. Killing the Eximus or downing it into a Mercy state will disrupt any active health leech zones.
	 
	
	
		 SHOCK / BIO-ELECTRIC (new) 
	 
	
	
		
	 
	
	
		We have added a new Eximus variant by allowing Infested enemies to now become imbued with electric energy! Introducing: Bio-Electric Eximus, the newest Infested Eximus threatens to shock any Tenno to their senses if they fail to evade the Infested Eximus or their lethal homing electric orbs. 
	 
	
	
		Was 
		A small electrical Damage Over Time area. This is difficult to notice until hit with an Electric Status Effect. 
	 
	
	
		NEW 
		Shock Eximus/Bio-Electric Eximus spawn 3 electrical orbs that will hover in place for a few seconds, dealing increasing electrical damage around the Eximus before being released and homing in on the Player. The damage from these electrical orbs scale with level and deal sustained electric damage when chained to you, but no longer deal an Electric Status Effect. Killing the Eximus or putting it into a Mercy state will destroy any active Orbs. 
	 
	
	
		Visual Changes 
		Shock Eximus have mini versions of the electrical orbs orbiting around them, while they also appear to be covered and crackling with electricity.
	 
	
	
		 VENOMOUS 
	 
	
	
		
	 
	
	
		Was 
		A small Toxin area. Similar to shock Eximus, but Toxin damage is more lethal since it lingers on players. 
	 
	
	
		NEW 
		Venomous Eximus units become surrounded by a swirling volume of Toxic gas upon being alerted. Coming into contact with the gas will inflict a Toxin Status Effect. Now, only enemy melee units can become venomous Eximus units. Stay clear of their impending noxious fumes! 
	 
	
	
		Visual Changes 
		Venomous Eximus are tightly shrouded in toxic fumes. Upon being alerted, these fumes expand into a zone surrounding the Eximus in a deadly haze. 
	 
	
	
		 REWARDS
	 
	
	
		To accompany the increased threat from Eximus units, we’ve further boosted the Affinity gained from killing them by +200%. Additionally, Eximus units now drop Credits and Endo at an increased rate. This will consistently scale as well for their Steel Path counterparts on top of the usual rare chance of a Riven Sliver! 
	 
	
	
		ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:
	 
	
	
			Considering Eximus enemies are now more formidable, that strength is amplified when encountering Eximus units in a pack. To help counter that in different parts of Warframe we’ve made the following changes: 
			
					There will be 50% less Eximus on ‘Eximus Stronghold’ Sortie conditions
				 
				
					Syndicate Death Squad/Platoon sizes have been reduced:
					
							-1 of disfavor Squads reduced from 5-10 to 3-5 
						 
						
							-2 of disfavor Platoons reduced from 10-15 to 5-7
							
									We have increased the drop chance of Eximus Specter blueprints dropping from Syndicate Death Squads in light of the size reduction. 
								 
							 
					 
				
					Additionally, we have greatly reduced the additional Health and Shields these Units receive
				 
			 
		
			Syndicate Exmus Specters have also had their respective Eximus type updated: Here are the following Eximus Specters and Type: 
			
					Ancient Healer Eximus: Volatile
				 
				
					Charger Eximus: Venomous
				 
				
					MOA Eximus: Arctic 
				 
				
					Corruper Lancer: Arson 
				 
				
					Roller Eximus: Energy Leech 
				 
				
					Shield Osprey Eximus: Shock 
				 
			 
		
			Warden Eximus units in Rescue missions have not received these new Eximus upgrades, to ensure they are just as easy to stealthily remove as before.
		 
	
		Caution Tenno, there’s a heavy unit approaching...  
		 
	 
	
	
		New Player Experience: Quality Of Life Changes
	 
	
	
			Completing the Heart of Deimos quest will now reward you with the Voidrig Blueprint,  Voidrig Weapon Blueprint, Voidrig Capsule Blueprint, Voidrig Engine Blueprint, and Voidrig Casing Blueprint in the post-quest Inbox.
			
					As a follow up to our Necramech Drop Rate &amp; Crafting Cost Changes from Update 30.9.0, we wanted to add another way to set up players for success as they continue their journey to The New War and other content that requires a Necramech to participate. 
				 
				
					For those who have already completed the Heart of Deimos quest prior to this update, these Blueprints will also be retroactively sent via Inbox. We will also be running an Alert on all platforms that rewards 4 Orokin Animus Matrices. More information on that here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1305860-orokin-animus-matrices-alert/
				 
			 
		
			Junction Changes:
			
					Removed the ‘Craft a Warframe Specter’ from the Europa Junction Task list. 
					
							In an effort to help players move through the Star Chart, we removed the 8 hour Specter-crafting time gate that this task created. 
						 
					 
				
					Reduced the ‘Open Meso Void Relics’ Uranus Junction task from 3 to 1 in the Uranus Junction.
				 
				
					Reduced the ‘Scan Cephalon Fragments on Mars’ Phobos Junction task from 3 to 1. 
				 
			 
	
		 
	 
	
	
		Clan Recruitment Changes 
	 
	
	
		Do you hear that Tenno? Maroo is calling. She’s got some great intel on where to find new Clan members. We have added some new features to Clan recruitment to supplement finding Clans and attracting new members.
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		Clans can now post ads by visiting Maroo in her Bazaar or accessing their Clan Menu and paying Maroo an administrative fee using resources from your Clan Vault. Each week, Maroo will be in need of a different resource for her own ‘endeavors’ and in exchange she will put the word out for you. These ads will appear in the updated Clan Menu under ‘Search for Clan’. 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		Clans can leave a brief description about their Clan’s interests and also add flags to help prospective members filter ads. These flags include:
	 
	
	
			Beginner Friendly
		 
		
			High MR Requirement
		 
		
			Regular Login Requirement
		 
		
			Max Research Complete
		 
		
			Decorated Dojo
		 
		
			Competitive Event Focus
		 
		
			Endurance Run Squads
		 
		
			Fashion Frame
		 
		
			Multiple Languages
		 
	
		Clan ads are displayed for 8 hours and then expire. During this time, prospective members can apply for a Clan and send a message to anyone with the new ‘Advertiser’ role for review and approval. If your Clan reaches maximum member capacity while your ad is live then your ad will be hidden until it expires or if you are no longer at capacity. If you apply to multiple Clans, then the first Clan to accept you will be your new family and all other applications will be immediately withdrawn.
	 
	
	
		Like many other areas where you are able to provide a custom message, players can report a Clan ad if it violates any of our Terms of Service, Code of Conduct, or leads to any form of discrimination or harassment of other players. Recruit to your heart’s content, Tenno, but as always we ask that you keep Warframe a welcoming space for all.
	 
	
	
		This new feature is not meant to replace the ways that Tenno connect, but rather add a streamlined avenue to find and connect with others. For more on this feature, please read our post here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1305861-additional-clan-recruitment-tools/ 
		 
	 
	
	
		 
	
	
		Maggot Decorations
	 
	
	
		A new Decoration has arrived and we are crawling with excitement. Nidus’ Maggot is now available in the Market as a Decoration for your Orbiter. You can adopt this adorable Infested creeper today and watch as it scuttles around. When we released Nidus Prime Access back on September 8th, 2021 we had originally hoped to include the prime versions of his Infested creepers as an additional ship Decoration. 
	 
	
	
		For those Tenno who purchased the Parasitic Link Pack, Ravenous Pack, and Nidus Prime Accessories Pack on PC, we will be delivering by script the Prime version of Nidus’ Maggot. Due to how Prime Access &amp; Prime Accessories are offered on consoles, to ensure parity those who purchased the Parasitic Link or Prime Accessories will receive 1 Prime Maggot and those who purchased the Ravenous Pack will receive 2 Prime Maggots via this script. These packs will also be updated for future purchases to include the Prime Maggot Decoration.
	 
	
	
		Audio Reverb Changes: 
	 
	
	
		Our sound team has made several changes to reverb across the game thanks to a new system! This nifty new tech automatically places reverb in level zones instead of the hand placing that used to happen in every tile. This allows us to get better results because it takes into account area size and area materials. It also includes preset reverb containers that can have more types of reverb that are better suited to each area. 
	 
	
	
		For example: A small, narrow vent space that opens to a small room that then opens to a larger room can each have their own custom reverb based on the size and material type of each room. Instead of hand placing each of the three reverbs, the engine is now smart enough to take into account each of the rooms automatically. This allows for greater specificity because it measures the size of each room. 
	 
	
	
		This also has a performance benefit, as it enables only the required reverb sample to be loaded as needed, instead of loading all of them when a level first loads. This ultimately saves memory and allows the levels to load a bit faster!  
		 
	 
	
	
		Additions: 
	 
	
	
			Added ‘Hair Z’ customization for a Spoiler character from The New War quest.
			
					This hair has been re-added after needing to go through some rigorous quality checks, as previously mentioned here: https://forums.warframe.com/topic/1292278-missing-a-drifter-hairstyle-still/?do=findComment&amp;comment=12375732

					Vaulted Relics will also now be described as such in the ‘Drop Sources’ description when hovering over a Relic in the Relic management screen.
				 
			 
	
		Plains of Eidolon Thumper Changes &amp; Fixes:
	 
	
	
			Made improvements to Plains Thumper movement.
		 
		
			Changed post-New War quest Plains of Eidolon Thumpers to have quest-specific detailing during specific bounties.

			Fixed Plains Thumper cannon and shotgun turret attack consistency.
		 
	
		DirectX 12 Performance and Optimizations:
	 
	
	
		Ongoing work continues on our DirectX12 render mode! 
	 
	
	
		In this update, DirectX 12 runs up to 25% faster than it used to for high performance PCs. Most modern systems will run the game in DirectX 12 mode significantly faster than DirectX 11!
	 
	
	
		Comparing the same scene across different versions of the game to compare how the rendering modes compare:
	 
	
	
			New War DX11: 110 fps
		 
		
			New War DX12: 141 fps
		 
		
			Angels of Zariman DX12: 177 fps
		 
	
		 
	
	
		The system that was used for the above testing results: Ryzen 5600X, Radeon 6900XT;  1080p Enhanced renderer with all details at maximum. 
	 
	
	
		A significant memory optimization was also made, and DX12 now uses up to 200 megabytes less memory than it did previously (especially relevant for players on laptops where the memory is shared).
	 
	
	
		Be sure to make sure you&#039;ve got the most recent drivers before trying it out! 
		 
	 
	
	
		General Optimizations:

		Changes: 
	 
	
	
			You can now zoom in and out of your Warframe while customizing their Appearance in the Arsenal! 
			
					For Keyboard &amp; Mouse users: Scroll with mouse wheel, click and drag to move up/down. 
				 
				
					For Controller users: 
					
							R stick up/down = zoom 
						 
						
							R stick left/right = spin
						 
						
							Wherever your cursor is height wise on the screen is where it will zoom into, you can move up and down using cursor and right stick in up position.    
						 
					 
			 
		
			Here by popular request, we have added a confirmation prompt to the ‘Randomize’ button when randomizing in the Arsenal!   
		
			Nova&#039;s Null Star will no longer launch projectiles at enemies which are dead or downed (ex: disabled Bursas, downed Hounds/Thralls). This is to prevent wasting charges.
		 
		
			Challenges have been moved to a new button in the pause menu that is accessible while in mission. Selecting that button will open a screen that shows the state of your currently available challenges, including Nightwave, Evolution (Protovyre, etc.), Riven, and Account. There is also a tab for completed challenges!   
		
			Added a cap of 200 for Companion Imprints. Imprints can also be sold from Inventory for Credits.

			Players who are over their Riven Capacity can now offer a Riven mod for Trade.  
			
					Previously, you were unable to offer any Rivens for Trade if you were over capacity. Now, you can offer a Riven mod when at capacity, but will continue to not be able to receive a Riven via trade when at capacity as it cannot be exceeded.
				 
			 
		
			Grenade changes:
			
					Grenade AOEs are now telegraphed! Once they have made contact with a surface, their detonation radius is now indicated. 
				 
				
					Grenades will no longer ignore cover, meaning it will no longer deal punchthrough damage if you are behind cover. 
				 
				
					Reduced damage radius of Grenades. 
				 
			 
		
			Arcane descriptions now include what they can be equipped on.  
		
			Mastery Rank 30 test changes:
			
					Increased the Life Support pickups from 10% to 20% in the Master Rank 30 test. 
				 
				
					Lowered the levels of the Eximus units that spawn in the test due to the Eximus changes making them a more formidable opponent.

			Cetus &amp; Orb Vallis Drones, Specters, Companions, &amp; Rescue Targets):

			Made it impossible for enemies to be able to detonate/shoot down player explosive projectiles (Ogris for example).
			
					Prior to this change, while rare, it was possible for enemies to shoot down explosives and cause damage to players/objectives. Given that this was essentially unpredictable and unavoidable, we have removed the ability for enemies to do so.
